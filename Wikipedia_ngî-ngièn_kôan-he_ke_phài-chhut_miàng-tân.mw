==All Wikipedias ordered by number of articles==
The languages listed below are Wikipedias which have been created (ordered by number of articles and within each number alphabetically from A to Z). Their progress should also be tracked at [[:en:Wikipedia:Multilingual statistics|Multilingual statistics]]. These tables can also be kept up to date by ordinary users. If you feel that an update is needed, simply cut and paste the wiki syntax from [http://s23.org/wikistats/wikipedias_wiki.php this page] (which is updated by script fairly regularly) into [[/Table|this page]], overwriting the existing tables.
