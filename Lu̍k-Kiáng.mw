'''Luk Keng Chan Uk''' (鹿頸陳屋) is a village situated in the [[Luk Keng (North District)|Luk Keng]] area, in the northeastern part of the [[New Territories]], [[Hong Kong]]. It is however a popular tourist attraction for sightseeing and hiking.

As the name suggests, this village is mainly inhabited by the Chan (陳 [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]] ts<sup>h</sup>in11 ) Clan. Though mainly inhabited by the Chan clan, there are other different surnames in the village such as Wong. It is a [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]] speaking village. Historically, the village was used for livestock farming and growing crops. Today, the village is mostly uninhabited. The ruins of the village school can be seen.

Luk Keng is well-known for its natural scenery and wildlife, which is a contrast to Hong Kong's modernised culture. Parts of Luk Keng are surrounded by tropical rainforests. Rare animals such as the [[Nannophya pygmaea]] and [[Black-faced Spoonbill]] have been sighted in Luk Keng, as well as monkeys. Waterfalls are present in Luk Keng.

In the 1950s and 1960s, many villagers left for the UK and other parts of the world.  This was to an extent affected by the immigration policy of the UK at the time.  There being little work to do in the village but plenty of money to be made elsewhere. The 1960s was also a time of riots and disruption in Hong Kong. Furthermore, many people feared the return of Hong Kong in 1997, so many people sent their children abroad, as they knew all about the Cultural Revolution and other happenings in the PRC just across the border.  

So far, little development has taken place in Luk Keng, mainly because government had zoned the area mainly as agricultural and conservation.  This is despite that most of the land is owned by the villagers.  As a result, many villagers are very dissatisfied in that they are not allowed to develop and thus no houses can be built by which returning villagers can stay.  Some other opinions are that government has chosen the villagers' land to be maintained as a green area for the rest of Hong Kong, yet the government is not buying the land.  If the government wanted to keep it for environmental reasons then it should buy up the land from the villagers and use it as a public park.
