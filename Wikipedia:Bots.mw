* '''en:''' Requests for the [[m:bot|bot]] flag should be made on this page.

Other bots should apply below, and then [[m:Steward requests/Bot status|request access]] from a steward if there is no objection.

'''Summary of the Bot policy'''
# Respect [[m:Bot policy]] and relevant policies.
# Identify your bot on its [[:en:Project:User page|user page]] using the {{Tl|bot}} template.
# Provide following information on both the bot's user page and the approval request:
#* Details of the bot's task (or tasks)
#* Whether the bot is manually assisted or runs automatically
#* When it operates (continuously, intermittently, or at specified intervals), and at what rate
#* The language and/or program that it is running
# Keep intervals of '''10 (ten) seconds or longer''' between edits.
#* During the peak hours, try to refrain from running your bot, or slow it down at intervals of 20 (twenty) seconds or longer.
# Unflagged bots shall not edit many pages at high speed.
#* Edit at intervals of '''one minute or longer when editing 200 or more pages without bot status'''.
# When requesting for approval of your bot, demonstrate a test run of 40 to 200 edits.  
#* If the task is <u>maintaining interlanguage links</u> or <u>fixing double-redirects</u>, you may start a test run without prior consensus.
#* If local users found no problem, a bureaucrat may grant bot status to your bot.
# List your bot in [[Wikipedia:Bot]].
