== Notes ==
The template can display up to nine parties or nominees at the same time, three per row. If exactly four are needed, use the first two on the top and bottom lines. This is done by only using the numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5 on the fields that require a number.

All the fields that work for Legislative will also work for Parliamentary. The only difference between the two is the titles above the images.

The template uses the party fields to display the party colour in the background of the images and some text. To turn this function off, input:
 | party_colour      = no
To override the calling of the party short name templates, input:
 | party_name        = no
To override the calling of the alliance short name templates, input:
 | alliance_name     = no
To override the colour for party1 or nominee1, input:
 | colour1           = [HEX OF COLOUR, MINUS #]
The hex number must be entered without the hash for the field to work. The number (colour'''1''') can be changed up to nine for different parties or Nominees. The fields work with both spellings of the word 'color'.

=== Which leader to use ===
The parties are shown in the infobox in the order they came in the election. The "leader" of each party is the person leading the party through that election.
