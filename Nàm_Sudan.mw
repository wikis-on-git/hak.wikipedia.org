==Background==
[[Nokia]] was for a long time the worldwide market leader in the mobile phone and smartphone market, and its brand eventually became a [[Brand awareness|household name]] in many countries. After internal struggles&mdash;and a failed series of [[Windows Phone]] smartphones which ultimately had low global market share&mdash;the company sold its mobile phone business to [[Microsoft]] in 2014, who then formed [[Microsoft Mobile]]. The "Nokia" brand continued to be used by Microsoft until it was retired for [[Nokia Lumia|Lumia]] smartphones in October 2014, but remaining for [[feature phone]]s. Because of its historic success the Nokia brand was still widely recognized and trusted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpointresearch.com/nokia-brand-relives/ |title=Nokia Brand Relives » counterpoint |website=CounterpointResearch.com |date=1 December 2016 |access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref>

The CEO of Nokia, [[Rajeev Suri]], confirmed in June 2015 that the Nokia brand will return to smartphones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2448045/mwc-2016-nokia-confirms-plan-to-return-to-smartphones|title=MWC 2016: Nokia confirms plan to return to smartphones |website=V3.co.uk|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Earlier that year Nokia Technologies released the [[Nokia N1|N1]] tablet running [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and images of a ''Nokia C1'' G smartphone were leaked several times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/nokia-c1-leaked-again-with-specifications-and-fresh-images-771743|title=Nokia C1 Leaked Again With Specifications and Fresh Images|website=Gadgets.ndtv.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Under the agreements of the Microsoft sale, Nokia would not be allowed to sell phones, if they had developed, with the Nokia brand until it would expire on December 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/will-nokia-launch-new-trademarked-smartphones-2016-after-lock-period-microsoft-ends-1471858|title=Nokia Planning New Smartphones in 2016 after License Agreement with Microsoft Ends?|first=Rahul|last=R|date=27 October 2014|website=Ibtimes.co.uk|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Suri said in February 2016 that he wanted the company to be in a position where it co-designs with another manufacturer but keeping "appropriate control measures".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/nokia-ceo-says-company-no-rush-return-smartphone-market|title=Nokia CEO says company is in 'no rush' to return to smartphone market|date=22 February 2016|website=Windowscentral.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>

On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile announced the sale of its feature phone business to a new Finnish start-up called HMD Global Oy.

After the announcement of Google's [[Open Handset Alliance]] in November 2007, Nokia said it "considered" joining the alliance, despite its majority stake in [[Symbian Ltd.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/nokia-considering-joining-google-alliance-155036|title=Nokia considering joining Google alliance|website=Techradar.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Nokia eventually did not join and instead created the rival [[Symbian Foundation]] in 2008 after taking control of the [[Symbian]] operating system and making it [[open source]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://betanews.com/2008/06/24/new-symbian-foundation-to-take-on-android-limo/|title=New Symbian Foundation to take on Android, LiMo|website=BetaNews|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/symbian_expands/|title=Symbian Foundation in anti-Android recruit drive|website=Theregister.co.uk|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> In 2010 as competition stiffened, Nokia lost some partners of the Symbian Foundation who then supported Google only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/samsung-finally-admits-symbian-split-720398|title=Samsung finally admits Symbian split|website=Techradar.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> By now Nokia planned to replace Symbian with the [[Linux]]-based [[MeeGo]] after the [[Nokia N9|N9]] flagship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/nov/29/nokia-symbian-closes-meego-awaits|title=Nokia closes Symbian to the world: can MeeGo make up the gap?|first=Charles|last=Arthur|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=20 August 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

Under CEO [[Stephen Elop]] the company chose to halt the MeeGo project in favor of adopting [[Windows Phone]], which resulted in a partnership with Microsoft in 2011, with Symbian to be relegated. Google's chief executive [[Eric Schmidt]] confirmed that the company held extensive "confidential negotiations" with Nokia to encourage using Android.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8327677/Google-Nokia-made-wrong-choice-with-Microsoft.html|title=Google: Nokia 'made wrong choice', with Microsoft|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Despite this, Nokia still experimented with Android that year and leaked images showed a [[Nokia N9]] prototype running Android.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/mystery-nokia-n9-looking-phone-seen-running-android-20222.html|title=Mystery Nokia N9-Looking Phone Seen Running Android|website=Tech2|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> In late 2013 when [[Microsoft]] announced its intention to purchase the Nokia mobile phone division, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that a team at Nokia were secretly testing Android on [[Microsoft Lumia|Lumia]] devices, but that Microsoft was aware of this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/nokia-was-testing-android-lumia-phones-before-microsoft-1310162514|title=Nokia Was Testing Android Lumia Phones Before Microsoft Swallowed It|first=Casey|last=Chan|website=Gizmodo.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Some analysts think Microsoft bought the business because Nokia were thinking of switching to Android, which could have resulted in Microsoft losing its dominant Windows Phone OEM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/analysts-microsoft-bought-nokia-because-nokia-was-going-to-stop-making-windows-phones-2013-9?IR=T|title=Analysts: Microsoft Bought Nokia Because Nokia Was Going To Stop Making Windows Phones|website=Businessinsider.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> In December 2013 there were leaks of a Nokia Android smartphone codenamed ''Normandy'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/172607-nokias-android-smartphone-is-full-steam-ahead-for-2014-release-but-what-about-windows-phone|title=Nokia's Android smartphone is 'full steam ahead' for 2014 release... but what about Windows Phone? |website=Extremetech.com|date=11 December 2013|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> which was eventually introduced as the [[Nokia X family|Nokia X]] series in February 2014, featuring a heavily customized version of the [[Android Open Source Project]] (AOSP) and released in emerging markets. The acquisition was completed just two months later, and Microsoft discontinued the X series soon afterwards.  In an interview with [[Forbes]], former HMD CEO Arto Nummela stated that the [[Nokia X family]] surprisingly became popular with users of high end Samsung and Apple smartphone devices, despite the fact that it was a mid to low end device series.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/12/04/hmd-nokia-smartphone-android-google-play/#56cf97897a91</ref>

After the sale, the Nokia Technologies division developed the [[Nokia N1|N1]] Android tablet featuring the [[Z Launcher]] interface, released in China in 2015. Later that year images of a N1-like phone with Android called the ''C1'' was leaked.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/08/nokia-c1-android-phone-leak/|title=Nokia's first Android phone reportedly breaks cover|website=Engadget|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Nokia CEO [[Rajeev Suri]] confirmed the return of the Nokia brand to smartphones in June 2015 through a licensing strategy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/nokia/11738371/Nokia-confirms-plans-to-return-to-mobile-phone-market.html|title=Nokia confirms plans to return to mobile phone market|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> and the formation of HMD Global was finally announced in May 2016.

A strong point critically of HMD's Nokia smartphones has been build quality and design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/nokia-new-phones-mwc2017/|title=HMD's Nokia 6 is now available in the U.S. for $229|date=26 June 2017|website=Digitaltrends.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-6|title=Nokia 6 Review: Is this the budget Android phone to beat?
