* The Hakka wikipedia is lack of many css and js files, some templates seems didn't work, anothers seems a little ugly.

*{{Chan-sṳ̀n}}. We also need a bot to assist with article stub creations and linking those articles with their appropriate interwikis, similar to [https://zh-min-nan.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot#Bot_flag_request_for_S205643bot this bot]. I really don't have the time these days to implement one myself so perhaps you could give it a try? --[[用戶:Chrysolophus pictus|Chrysolophus pictus]] ([[用戶討論:Chrysolophus pictus|對話]]) 08:41, 19 十二月 2015 (UTC)
