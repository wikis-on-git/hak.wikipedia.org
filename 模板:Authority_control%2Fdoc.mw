== Description ==
{{details|Authority control|Wikipedia:Authority control}}
This metadata template links Wikipedia articles to various library (and other) catalogue systems, for biographies and other topics.

This template draws most of its values from [[Wikidata]], but they can be overridden by locally entered data. Adding the data to Wikidata is preferable.

If there is no information in Wikidata for the specific subject, an empty instance of this template will be ''dormant'', meaning it will be invisible on the rendered page. Thus, using this template on a page with no authority information is harmless.

An empty instance of this template stays dormant in an article, until values are added to Wikidata, when it will then display them, so this template should be added to all biographies, whether or not there are authority control identifiers in Wikidata already.

=== User pages ===

The template may also be placed on user pages, but then data must be entered locally.

== Data types ==

Wikidata content is used as fallback for all identifiers.

The template validates digits for all values and shows an error if the check fails.

Wherever possible, the template also generates a link to [[WorldCat Identities]], using VIAF or LCCN values, or manually via {{para|WORLDCATID}}.

== Position ==
{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Standard appendices and footers{{!}}Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout}}
As a metadata template, the Authority control template should be placed after the [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] section and [[Wikipedia:Navigation templates|navigation templates]], right before the categories.

==Usage==
As a rule of thumb: (1) insert the empty version, (2) click "Show preview" to see which sources are automatically pulled from Wikidata, (3a) if you know more sources, add them in the template using their named parameter, (3b) alternatively, consider adding them to the article's "Wikidata item", so that all versions of Wikipedia will automatically benefit.

{{Anchor|Wikidata|Tracking categories}}

==Wikidata and tracking categories==
The template can get its information from the following properties on [[Wikidata]]:

{{#invoke:Authority control|docConfTable}}

=== Additional tracking categories ===
This template may add the following categories:
* {{clc|Pages with red-linked authority control categories}} – error category to identify missing categories
* {{clc|Wikipedia articles with deprecated authority control identifiers}} – fix/migrate/remove deprecated IDs
* {{clc|Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers}} – tracking only (no error)
* {{clc|Pages using authority control with parameters}} – articles and categories transcluding this template with explicit parameters, i.e. not loaded from WikiData (no error)
* {{clc|VIAF not on Wikidata}}
* {{clc|VIAF different on Wikidata}}
* {{clc|Wikipedia articles with WorldCat identifiers}}
* {{clc|Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-LCCN identifiers}}
* {{clc|Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers}}

== Error reports ==
{{Template error report}}

== Microformat ==
The template wraps each UID value with the [[HTML]] markup: <code><nowiki><span class="uid">...</span></nowiki></code>, which enables the first-found value to be included in an [[hCard]] [[microformat]]. For that reason, VIAF, where present, is emitted first.
