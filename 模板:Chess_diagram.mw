Parameters:
*<alignment> - defines horizontal alignment of the whole image, must be "tright" or "tleft";
*<header> - the text which appears above the diagram, may be empty;
*<a8>, <b8>, ... <nowiki><h1></nowiki> - define corresponding squares of the chessboard, see below;
*<footer> - the text which appears beneath the diagram, may be empty.

A square is defined by the name of piece or empty parameter. The names of the pieces are those given in algebraic notation:
*[[Image:Chess kll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess kld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess kdl44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess kdd44.png|22px]] k = king 
*[[Image:Chess qld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess qll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess qdd44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess qdl44.png|22px]] q = queen 
*[[Image:Chess rll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess rld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess rdl44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess rdd44.png|22px]] r = rook 
*[[Image:Chess bld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess bll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess bdd44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess bdl44.png|22px]] b = bishop 
*[[Image:Chess nll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess nld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess ndl44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess ndd44.png|22px]] n = knight

There are also some [[fairy chess piece]]s available:
*[[Image:Chess all44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess ald44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess adl44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess add44.png|22px]] a = archbishop (knight + bishop compound)
*[[Image:Chess cld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess cll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess cdd44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess cdl44.png|22px]] c = chancelor (knight + rook compound)
*[[Image:Chess fll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess fld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess fdl44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess fdd44.png|22px]] f = upside-down king 
*[[Image:Chess gld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess gll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess gdd44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess gdl44.png|22px]] g = upside-down queen

*[[Image:Chess eld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess ell44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess edd44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess edl44.png|22px]] e = upside-down bishop
*[[Image:Chess sll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess sld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess sdl44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess sdd44.png|22px]] s = upside-down knight 
*[[Image:Chess hld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess hll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess hdd44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess hdl44.png|22px]] h = upside-down pawn 
*[[Image:Chess_zll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess zld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess zdl44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess zdd44.png|22px]] z = champion (for Omega Chess) 
*[[Image:Chess wld44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess wll44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess wdd44.png|22px]][[Image:Chess wdl44.png|22px]] w = wizard (for Omega Chess) 

These letters are combined with either "l" for Light=White, or "d" for Dark=Black. So "kl" is White's king, and "nd" is Black's knight. 

An empty square is written either using underscores, spaces, or nothing at all. Two spaces are recommended. You can also use "xx" for a cross, "xo" for a black circle on an empty square or "oo" for a white one. Numbers can also be added to squares by using "x1" for 1, "x2" for 2, ..., "x9" for 9.
