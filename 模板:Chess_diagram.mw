A square is defined by the name of piece or empty parameter. The names of the pieces are those given in algebraic notation:

These letters are combined with either "l" for Light=White, or "d" for Dark=Black. So "kl" is White's king, and "nd" is Black's knight. 

An empty square is written either using underscores, spaces, or nothing at all. Two spaces are recommended. You can also use "xx" for a cross, "xo" for a black circle on an empty square or "oo" for a white one. Numbers can also be added to squares by using "x1" for 1, "x2" for 2, ..., "x9" for 9.
