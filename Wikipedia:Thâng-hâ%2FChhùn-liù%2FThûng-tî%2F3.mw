== Inspire Campaign: Improving diversity, improving content ==

This March, we’re organizing an Inspire Campaign to encourage and support new ideas for improving gender diversity on Wikimedia projects. Less than 20% of Wikimedia contributors are women, and many important topics are still missing in our content. We invite all Wikimedians to participate. If you have an idea that could help address this problem, please get involved today! The campaign runs until March 31.

All proposals are welcome - research projects, technical solutions, community organizing and outreach initiatives, or something completely new! Funding is available from the Wikimedia Foundation for projects that need financial support. Constructive, positive feedback on ideas is appreciated, and collaboration is encouraged - your skills and experience may help bring someone else’s project to life. Join us at the Inspire Campaign and help this project better represent the world’s knowledge!

Hello, I made [[:m:Requests_for_comment/Confirmation_of_stewards|a proposal on Meta]] to change the rules for the steward confirmations. Currently consensus to remove is required for a steward to lose his status, however I think it's fairer to the community if every steward needed the consensus to keep.

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|Nominations are being accepted for 2015 Wikimedia Foundation elections]] ==

''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Committee|2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/MassMessages/Accepting nominations|Translations]] are available.''
[[File:Wmf logo vert pms.svg|100px|right]]
Greetings,

I am pleased to announce that nominations are now being accepted for the 2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections. This year the Board and the FDC Staff are looking for a diverse set of candidates from regions and projects that are traditionally under-represented on the board and in the movement as well as candidates with experience in technology, product or finance. To this end they have [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|published letters]] describing what they think is needed and, recognizing that those who know the community the best are the community themselves, the election committee is [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|accepting nominations]] for community members you think should run and will reach out to those nominated to provide them with information about the job and the election process.

This year, elections are being held for the following roles:

''Board of Trustees''<br/>
The Board of Trustees is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long term sustainability of the Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection.  There are three positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/Board elections/2015|the board elections page]].    

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)''<br/>
The Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) makes recommendations about how to allocate Wikimedia movement funds to eligible entities.  There are five positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC elections/2015|the FDC elections page]].

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) Ombud''<br/>
The FDC Ombud receives complaints and feedback about the FDC process, investigates complaints at the request of the Board of Trustees,  and summarizes the investigations and feedback for the Board of Trustees on an annual basis.  One position is being filled.  More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC Ombudsperson elections/2015|the FDC Ombudsperson elections page]]. 

The candidacy submission phase lasts from 00:00 UTC April 20 to 23:59 UTC May 5 for the Board and from 00:00 UTCApril 20 to 23:59 UTC April 30 for the FDC and FDC Ombudsperson. This year, we are accepting both self-nominations and nominations of others. More information on this election and the nomination process can be found on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|the 2015 Wikimedia elections page on Meta-Wiki]].

Please feel free to post a note about the election on your project's village pump. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the talk page on Meta, or sent to the election committee's mailing list, board-elections -at- wikimedia.org 

On behalf of the Elections Committee,<br/>

== Please test VisualEditor in your language! ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|right|frameless]]
It is very important to us at the [[:mw:Editing|Editing Department]] that [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Portal|VisualEditor]] works in every language, for every user.

VisualEditor's editing environment is a browser ContentEditable element. This means that your [[:en:Input method|input method editor]] (IME) should already know how to work with it. However, to make VisualEditor correctly edit wiki pages, we have to stop browsers in lots of ways from breaking the page.

Sometimes this can interfere with IMEs. To make sure we work in your IME, we need your help: please see '''[http://wikimedia.github.io/VisualEditor/demos/ve/desktop-dist.html#!pages/simple.html wikimedia.github.io/VisualEditor/demos/ve/desktop-dist.html#!pages/simple.html]'''. This is the core system inside VisualEditor which lets you write and edit. It is different from the full editor, and some of the tools you are used to will be missing.

We're interested in particular in whether you can write text at all, what happens when you select different candidate texts, and how VisualEditor behaves in general.

More details, and some early test results, are provided here: '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/IME_Testing#What_to_test|mediawiki.org/wiki/VisualEditor/IME_Testing#What_to_test]]'''.

We would love to hear from every language, and especially languages which use IMEs, like Japanese, Korean, Indic languages, Arabic and others. Thank you for your help.

Yours,

[[:mw:User:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]] [[:mw:User talk:Jdforrester (WMF)|(talk)]] 07:41, 22 四月 2015 (UTC)

== Pywikibot compat will no longer be supported - Please migrate to pywikibot core ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
<small>Sorry for English, I hope someone translates this.</small><br />
[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot|Pywikibot]] (then "Pywikipediabot") was started back in 2002. In 2007 a new branch (formerly known as "rewrite", now called "core") was started from scratch using the MediaWiki API. The developers of Pywikibot have decided to stop supporting the compat version of Pywikibot due to bad performance and architectural errors that make it hard to update, compared to core.  If you are using pywikibot compat it is likely your code will break due to upcoming MediaWiki API changes (e.g. [[phab:T101524|T101524]]). It is highly recommended you migrate to the core framework. There is a  [[mw:Manual:Pywikibot/Compat deprecation|migration guide]], and please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot/Communication|contact us]] if you have any problem.

There is an upcoming MediaWiki API breaking change that compat will not be updated for. If your bot's name is in [https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-June/081931.html this list], your bot will most likely break.

Thank you,<br />

Hello! 

I'm pleased to announce the 2nd edition of the '''VisualEditor Translathon'''.

It is a translation rally, focused on interface messages and help pages related to [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]].
In order to participate, you need to '''[[:betawiki:Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon|sign up on the Translathon page]]''' on TranslateWiki.

The top 3 contributors will each win a Wikipedia t-shirt of their choice from [//store.wikimedia.org/ the Wikipedia store]<ref>You can choose between any short-sleeve shirt, or other items for the same value.</ref>. 
Translations made between '''July 15th and July 19th''' ([//www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cdt CDT time zone]) qualify<ref>This means both new translations, and updates for messages in the "Outdated" tab of the translation interface.</ref>. 

If you are at [//wikimania2015.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania Wikimania Mexico] this year,  you are also welcome to join a related sprint during the hackathon in '''Workplace 1 - Don Américo, Thursday 16 July at 4pm (CDT)''' at the conference venue, so you can meet other fellow translators and [//wikimania2015.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Hackathon_Day_2 get support if you need some].

Interface messages have the priority. You will need to create an account at translatewiki.net in order to work on them, if you don't have one. ''It is recommended to create the account ASAP'', so that it can be confirmed in time.

You can also help translate documentation pages about VisualEditor on mediawiki.org. You can use your Wikipedia account to work there.

You will find instructions, links and other details [[:betawiki:Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon|on the Translathon page]].

Thanks for your attention, and happy translating! <br>

== Wikidata: Access to data from arbitrary items is coming ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

When using data from Wikidata on Wikipedia and other sister projects, there is currently a limitation in place that hinders some use cases: data can only be accessed from the corresponding item. So, for example, the Wikipedia article about Berlin can only get data from the Wikidata item about Berlin but not from the item about Germany. This had technical reasons. We are now removing this limitation. It is already done for many projects. Your project is one of the next ones. We will roll out this feature here on August 12.

We invite you to play around with this new feature if you are one of the people who have been waiting for this for a long time. If you have technical issues/questions with this you can come to [[d:Wikidata:Contact the development team]].

A note of caution: Please be careful with how many items you use for a single page. If it is too many pages, loading might get slow. We will have to see how the feature behaves in production to see where we need to tweak and how.

How to use it, once it is enabled:
* Parser function: <nowiki>{{#property:P36|from=Q183}}</nowiki> to get the capital from the item about Germany
* Lua: see [[mw:Extension:Wikibase Client/Lua]]

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

Hi everyone,

As I have previously announced here we have now enabled the arbitrary access feature here. This means from now on you can make use of data from any Wikidata item in any article here. Before you could for example only access data about Berlin in the article about Berlin. If you want to find out more or have questions please come to [[d:Wikidata:Arbitrary access]]. I hope this will open up great possibilities for you and make your work easier.

== Community Wishlist Survey ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"> 

Hi everyone! Apologies for posting in English. Translations are very welcome.

The [[:m:Community Tech|Community Tech team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation is focused on building improved curation and moderation tools for experienced Wikimedia contributors. We're now starting a '''[[:m:2015 Community Wishlist Survey|Community Wishlist Survey]]''' to find the most useful projects that we can work on.

For phase 1 of the survey, we're inviting all active contributors to submit brief proposals, explaining the project that you'd like us to work on, and why it's important. Phase 1 will last for 2 weeks. In phase 2, we'll ask you to vote on the proposals. Afterwards, we'll analyze the top 10 proposals and create a prioritized wishlist.

While most of this process will be conducted in English, we're inviting people from any Wikimedia wiki to submit proposals. We'll also invite volunteer translators to help translate proposals into English. 

Your proposal should include: the problem that you want to solve, who would benefit, and a proposed solution, if you have one. You can submit your proposal on the Community Wishlist Survey page, using the entry field and the big blue button. We will be accepting proposals for 2 weeks, ending on November 23.
 
We're looking forward to hearing your ideas!

If you want to carefully review nearly a thousand applications in January, you might be a perfect committee member. Otherwise, you can '''volunteer as "ambassador"''': you will observe all the committee activities, ensure that people from your language or project manage to apply for a scholarship, translate '''scholarship applications written in your language''' to English and so on.

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Your input requested on the proposed #FreeBassel banner campaign]] ==

''This is a message regarding the [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|proposed 2015 Free Bassel banner]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Translations]] are available.''

Hi everyone,

This is to inform all Wikimedia contributors that a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|straw poll seeking your involvement]] has just been started on Meta-Wiki.

As some of your might be aware, a small group of Wikimedia volunteers have proposed a banner campaign informing Wikipedia readers about the urgent situation of our fellow Wikipedian, open source software developer and Creative Commons activist, [[:w:Bassel Khartabil|Bassel Khartabil]]. An exemplary [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|banner]] and an [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|explanatory page]] have now been prepared, and translated into about half a dozen languages by volunteer translators.

We are seeking [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|your involvement to decide]] if the global Wikimedia community approves starting a banner campaign asking Wikipedia readers to call on the Syrian government to release Bassel from prison. We understand that a campaign like this would be unprecedented in Wikipedia's history, which is why we're seeking the widest possible consensus among the community.

Given Bassel's urgent situation and the resulting tight schedule, we ask everyone to [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|get involved with the poll and the discussion]] to the widest possible extent, and to promote it among your communities as soon as possible.

(Apologies for writing in English; please kindly [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|translate]] this message into your own language.)

Thank you for your participation!

Hi everybody,   

My name is Erica, and I am a [[Mw:Community Engagement (Product)|Community Liaison]] at the Wikimedia Foundation. The [[mw:Editing/Team|Editing team at WMF]] wants to know what you think about [[:mw:VisualEditor|the visual editor]] on this Wikipedia. {{int:visualeditor}} is a way to edit articles that is similar to a word processing application.  The team has been working on support for languages that use input method editors (IMEs), such as this one.    

'''To test the visual editor, please:'''
# '''Opt-in to the visual editor''' by going to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]] and choosing "{{int:visualeditor}}".  Save your preferences.
# '''Edit any article or your user page''' in the visual editor. See the [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]] for information on how to use the visual editor. 
# '''Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested''' at [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv the feedback thread on Mediawiki.org].  The developers would like to know how well it works.  Please tell them what kind of computer, web browser, and keyboard you are using.  It is important that they hear from as many editors as possible.  You may leave your comments in any language. 

When language support has been refined a little more based on your feedback, all editors at this wiki can have access to the visual editor.  If you want to help prepare, please read [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/VE as Beta Feature|the advice on mediawiki.org]].

{{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Get involved in Wikipedia 15!]] ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/MassMessages/Get involved|Translations]] are available.''

[[File:International-Space-Station wordmark blue.svg|right|200px]]

As many of you know, January 15 is Wikipedia’s 15th Birthday!

People around the world are getting involved in the celebration and have started adding their [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|events on Meta Page]]. While we are celebrating Wikipedia's birthday, we hope that all projects and affiliates will be able to utilize this celebration to raise awareness of our community's efforts.

Haven’t started planning? Don’t worry, there’s lots of ways to get involved. Here are some ideas:

* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|Join/host an event]]'''. We already have more than 80, and hope to have many more.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media|Talk to local press]]'''. In the past 15 years, Wikipedia has accomplished extraordinary things. We’ve made a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/15 years|handy summary]] of milestones and encourage you to add your own. More resources, including a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media#releases|press release template]] and [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Communications/Movement Communications Skills|resources on working with the media]], are also available.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Material|Design a Wikipedia 15 logo]]'''. In place of a single icon for Wikipedia 15, we’re making dozens. Add your own with something fun and representative of your community. Just use the visual guide so they share a common sensibility.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events/Package#birthdaywish|Share a message on social media]]'''. Tell the world what Wikipedia means to you, and add #wikipedia15 to the post. We might re-tweet or share your message!

Everything is linked on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Wikipedia 15 Meta page]]. You’ll find a set of ten data visualization works that you can show at your events, and a [[c:Category:Wikipedia15 Mark|list of all the Wikipedia 15 logos]] that community members have already designed.

If you have any questions, please contact [[m:User:ZMcCune (WMF)|Zachary McCune]] or [[m:User:JSutherland (WMF)|Joe Sutherland]].

Thanks and Happy nearly Wikipedia 15!<br />
-The Wikimedia Foundation Communications team
