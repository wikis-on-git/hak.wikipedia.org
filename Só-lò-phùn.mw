=== Só-lò-phùn Tshûn 之富饒歲月 ===

The village was once the home of generations of Vòng 氏-kâ-族 (the Vong/Wong family). Recorded history suggests that after migrating movement in a south easterly direction (supposedly from, what is now, Mainland China), the name Wong Wai Hing was an early settler and founding forefather of Só-lò-phùn Tshûn. Other early settler's are Tsu Kim Gong; Sing Lueng Gong; Yuk Chung Gong; Si Yuen Gong. (Gong meaning forefather in the [[Hakka Language]]). These people lived circa 872 AD.

Today, the village is now derelict and is uninhabited. Descendants have either [[emigration|emigrated]] abroad or have relocated elsewhere, for example, to Hong Kong City.

The closest researched descendants of the Só-lò-phùn Tshûn are as follows: Si Chow Gong; Tsip Yuen Gong; Chun Kee Gong; Yuk Man Gong; Si Tak Gong; Yuk Choi Gong (all deceased).
