== The visual editor is coming to this wiki ==

[[File:Norwegian-road-sign-110.0 (fluorescent).svg|right|frameless]]
''Hello again. Please excuse the English.  {{Int:Please-translate}}.  {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}''

<mark>[[mw:VisualEditor/Portal|'''The visual editor''']] is coming to all editors at this Wikipedia on Monday, 25 January.</mark> It allows people to edit Wikipedia articles as if they were using word processing software.  

You don't have to wait until the deployment to test it; '''you can test the visual editor right now.''' To turn it on, select [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|"Beta"]] in your preferences. Choose "{{int:visualeditor}}" and click save.  When it is enabled, you will press the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" button to edit an article in the new software. To use the wikitext editor, you can press "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}". 

After the deployment, everyone will automatically have the option to use either the visual editor or the current wikitext editor. For more information about how to use the visual editor, see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]]. 

More information about [[mediawikiwiki:Help:VisualEditor/VE_as_the_main_editor|preparing for the visual editor is posted here]].
* It's easier to add templates if you've added [[mw:TemplateData|TemplateData]] information. 
* Please help translate the user interface and pages about the visual editor. See [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|the visual editor's TranslationCentral]] for general information. To translate the user guide, go to [[mediawikiwiki:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|the MediaWiki.org page]], and select "{{int:translate-tag-translate-link-desc}}". Your language should be available from the drop-down menu on the right. Once you've done this, you'll see the document in English side by side with any translation work already done in your language. You can add new translations or change old translations.  To [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-visualeditor-0-all&language= translate the user interface], you need to create an account at translatewiki.net. Contact me personally if you need help with that.
* Please let us know if you find any problems. You can report issues in [[phab:|Phabricator, the new bug tracking system]] or on the [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|central feedback page]] on MediaWiki.org. If you notice major issues affecting your project, please leave a note [[:mw:User talk:Elitre (WMF)|on my talk page]].  In case of emergency (like an unexpected bug causing widespread problems), please contact James Forrester, the product manager, at jforrester@wikimedia.org or on [[:m:IRC|IRC]] in the #mediawiki-visualeditor channel.

== 2016 WMF Strategy consultation ==

:{{int:Please-translate}}
Hello, all.

The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) has launched a consultation to help create and prioritize WMF strategy beginning July 2016 and for the 12 to 24 months thereafter. This consultation will be open, on Meta, from 18 January to 26 February, after which the Foundation will also use these ideas to help inform its Annual Plan. (More on our timeline can be found on that Meta page.)

Your input is welcome (and greatly desired) at the Meta discussion, [[:m:2016 Strategy/Community consultation|2016 Strategy/Community consultation]].

Apologies for English, where this is posted on a non-English project. We thought it was more important to get the consultation translated as much as possible, and good headway has been made there in some languages. There is still much to do, however! We created [[:m:2016 Strategy/Translations]] to try to help coordinate what needs translation and what progress is being made. :)

If you have questions, please reach out to me on my talk page or on the strategy consultation's talk page or by email to mdennis@wikimedia.org.

I hope you'll join us! [[:m:User:Mdennis (WMF)|Maggie Dennis]] via [[用戶:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[用戶討論:MediaWiki message delivery|對話]]) 19:06, 18 一月 2016 (UTC)

Hello again (and again, apologies for using English on this page. {{Int:Please-translate}}.  {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}})

As some of you have noticed, '''this Wikipedia now has [[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal|the visual editor]] ({{int:visualeditor}}) enabled for all users'''.  (We planned to do this on 25 January 2016.  However, last week, there was an unusual problem with an upgrade to MediaWiki. Thanks for your understanding.) There are now two tabs for editing: "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}". Click "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" to use the visual editor. Click "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" to edit using wikitext markup.  

All edits using the visual editor will be tagged with "{{Int:tag-visualeditor}}" in recent changes, watchlists, and page histories.  To access the [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide|User Guide for the  visual editor]], click on the "(?)" icon in its toolbar.  If you wish to disable this new system, this can be done under [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing|"Editing" in your preferences]].  

Please let us know if you find any problems.  You can report issues in [[phab:|Phabricator, the new bug tracking system]] or on the [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|central feedback page]] on MediaWiki.org. 

<mark>If you can translate from English into this wiki's language, or know anyone who can, please follow the links on the "translation table" and help your community get the best possible experience when it comes to interface messages and documentation related to the visual editor.</mark> [[:mw:User talk:Elitre (WMF)|Please contact me directly]] whenever you need help!

Happy editing, [[:mw:User:Elitre (WMF)|Elitre (WMF)]] [[:mw:User talk:Elitre (WMF)|(talk)]] 17:21, 1 二月 2016 (UTC)

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

''[[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2016/February|Read this in another language]] • [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]''

<div style="margin:0.5em;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}border:1px solid #AAA;padding:0.5em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200x70px|center|alt=The visual editor]]

'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

Among experienced editors, the visual editor's table editing is one of the most popular features.
[[File:VisualEditor table menu move column.png|alt=Screenshot showing a pop-up menu for column operations in a table|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
If you select the top of a column or the end of a row, you can quickly insert and remove columns and rows.  

Now, you can also rearrange columns and rows. Click "Move before" or "Move after" to swap the column or row with its neighbor.
You can read and help translate [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Indic, and Han scripts, and improving the single edit tab interface.   

=== Recent changes ===
You can '''switch from the wikitext editor to the visual editor''' after you start editing. This function is available to nearly all editors at most wikis except the Wiktionaries and Wikisources.    

Many local '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor have been redirected to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].

You can now re-arrange columns and rows in '''tables''', as well as copying a row, column or any other selection of cells and pasting it in a new location.    

The '''formula editor''' has two options: you can choose "Quick edit" to see and change only the LaTeX code, or "Edit" to use the full tool. The full tool offers immediate preview and an extensive list of symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab. 
This is similar to the system already used on the mobile website. ([[phab:T102398|T102398]]) Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time. Your last editing choice will be stored as an account preference for logged-in editors, and as a cookie for logged-out users. Logged-in editors will have these options in the {{int:prefs-editing}} tab of [[Special:Preferences]]:   
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}},
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}},
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}. (This is the state for people using the visual editor now.)
The visual editor uses the same search engine as [[Special:Search]] to find links and files. This search will get better at detecting typos and spelling mistakes soon. These improvements to search will appear in the visual editor as well.

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at most [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. This will affect the following languages, amongst others: 
[[:w:ja: |'''Japanese''']], [[:w:ko:|'''Korean''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']].
 
=== Let's work together ===
* Please try out the newest version of the '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' on [[test2wiki:Special:Random|test2.wikipedia.org]]. You may need to restore the default preferences (at the bottom of [[test2wiki:Special:Preferences]]) to see the initial prompt for options. Were you able to find a preference setting that will work for your own editing? Did you see [[:c:File:VisualEditor single edit tab preference dialog.png|the large preferences dialog box]] when you started editing an article there?  
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean, Arabic, Japanese, Indic, or Han scripts?</mark> Does typing in these languages feels natural in the visual editor? Language engineer [[:mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]] needs to know. Please see the instructions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test]] if you can help. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]].
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language! Join the [https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2016-February/084840.html Tech Talk about "Automated citations in Wikipedia: Citoid and the technology behind it"] with Sebastian Karcher on 29 February 2016.

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
== Updates to wiki search auto completion are arriving 10 March==

Hello!

{{Int:Please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}

The [[:m:User:CKoerner (WMF)/Work/Completion Suggester beta reminder and coming soon|completion suggester beta feature]] will become the default at the first group of wikis on '''Thursday, 10 March'''. This initial rollout will start with some of the smaller wikis to ensure the change happens in an organized way. The remaining wikis will receive the update on Wednesday, 16 March. This update brings three major improvements to search. Improved search result ordering, a tolerance for a small number of spelling errors, and suggests fewer typos.

Since December 2015, 19,000 editors have already opted into the completion suggester beta feature. Contributors are encouraged to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|try out the feature]] ahead of the release. Please share any comments on the Completion Suggester [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch/CompletionSuggester|discussion page]] in any language.

To learn more about the work of the Discovery department and other improvements to search, please check out [[wmfblog:2015/12/23/search-and-discovery-on-wikipedia/|the Wikimedia blog]].

== Server switch 2016 ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its newest data center in Dallas.
This will make sure Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.
To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems.

They will switch all traffic to the new data center on '''Tuesday, 19 April'''.<br/>
On '''Thursday, 21 April''', they will switch back to the primary data center.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.
We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future.

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 15 to 30 minutes on Tuesday, 19 April and Thursday, 21 April, starting at 14:00 UTC (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT).

If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.
We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.
If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.
Then you should be able to save your edit.
But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped.
Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal.
If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual.
Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be a code freeze for the week of 18 April.
No non-essential code deployments will take place.

This test was originally planned to take place on March 22.
April 19th and 21st are the new dates. 
You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for Q3 FY2015-2016 rollout|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]].
They will post any changes on that schedule.
There will be more notifications about this.

[[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). This will be enabled as a feature in the soon for all users, which can be turned on or off using a preference setting. We look forward to  your feedback and please do let us know if you have any questions. Details about Compact Language Links can be read in the [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project documentation]].

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. The main announcement can also be translated on [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links/Announcement_draft_June_2016|this page]]. Thank you. On behalf of the Wikimedia Language team: [[:mw:User:Runab_WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee (WMF)]] ([[mw:User talk:Runab_WMF|talk]])-13:06, 29 六月 2016 (UTC)

[[File:Compact-language-links-list.png|thumb|Screenshot of Compact Language Links interlanguage list]]

[[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). Based on several factors, this shorter list of languages is expected to be more relevant for them and valuable for finding similar content in a language known to them. More information about compact language links can be found in [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|the documentation]].

From today onwards, compact language links has been enabled as the default listing of interlanguage links on this wiki. However, using the button at the bottom, you will be able to see a longer list of all the languages the article has been written in. The setting for this compact list can be changed by using the checkbox under ''User Preferences -> Appearance -> Languages''

The compact language links feature has been tested extensively by the Wikimedia Language team, which developed it. However, in case there are any problems or other feedback please let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project talk page]]. It is to be noted that on some wikis the presence of an existing older gadget that was used for a similar purpose may cause an interference for compact language list. We would like to bring this to the attention of the admins of this wiki. Full details are on [[phab:T131455|this phabricator ticket]] (in English).

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. Thank you.

== Wikipedia to the Moon: invitation to edit ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Three weeks ago, you were invited to vote on how to take Wikipedia articles to the Moon. Community voting is over and the winning idea is to send all ‘’featured articles and lists’’ to the Moon. This decision means that, starting today, Wikipedians from all language communities are warmly invited to intensively work on their best articles and lists, and submit them to Wikipedia to the Moon. The central site to coordinate between communities will be Meta-Wiki. You will find an [[m:Wikipedia to the Moon/Working|overview and more information there]]. Hopefully, we will be able to represent as many languages as possible, to show Wikipedia’s diversity. Please feel kindly invited to edit on behalf of your community and tell us about your work on featured content!

Best, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia to the Moon/About|Moon team at Wikimedia Deutschland]] 14:10, 1 七月 2016 (UTC)

== Editing News #2—2016 ==

''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Newsletter/2016/June|Read this in another language]] • [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]''

<div style="float:right;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}margin-left:1em;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:1em;">

It's quick and easy to insert a references list.
[[File:VisualEditor References List Insert Menu-en.png|alt=Screenshot showing a dropdown menu with many items|center|frameless|150px]]  

Place the cursor where you want to display the references list (usually at the bottom of the page).  Open the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu and click the "{{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}" icon (three books).

If you are using several groups of references, which is relatively rare, you will have the opportunity to specify the group. If you do that, then only the references that belong to the specified group will be displayed in this list of references.
Finally, click "{{int:visualeditor-dialog-action-insert}}" in the dialog to insert the {{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}.  This list will change as you add more footnotes to the page.

You can read and help translate [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Arabic and Indic scripts, and adapting the visual editor to the needs of the Wikivoyages and Wikisources.   

=== Recent changes ===
The visual editor is now available to all users at most [[Wikivoyage:|Wikivoyages]].  It was also enabled for all contributors at the French Wikinews.

The '''[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' feature combines the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab.  It has been deployed to several Wikipedias, including Hungarian, Polish, English and Japanese Wikipedias, as well as to all Wikivoyages.  At these wikis, you can change your settings for this feature in the "{{int:prefs-editing}}" tab of [[Special:Preferences]]. The team is now reviewing the feedback and considering ways to improve the design before rolling it out to more people.

=== Future changes ===
The "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".   This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[M:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the remaining [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. The developers want to know whether typing in your language feels natural in the visual editor. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]]. This will affect several languages, including: [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']] and others.

The team is working with the volunteer developers who power Wikisource to provide the visual editor there, for opt-in testing right now and eventually for all users. ([[phab:T138966|T138966]]) 

The team is working on a modern wikitext editor.  It will look like the visual editor, and be able to use the citoid service and other modern tools.  This new editing system may become available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices around September 2016.  You can read about this project in a [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Roadmap/Update_2016-06-23|general status update on the Wikimedia mailing list]]. 

=== Let's work together ===
* Do you teach new editors how to use the visual editor? Did you help [[:mw:Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]]? Have you written or imported [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your most important citation templates?  <mark>Would you be willing to help new editors and small communities with the visual editor?  Please sign up for the new [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/Community Taskforce|'''VisualEditor Community Taskforce''']].</mark>
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[w:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language!  Watch the [[Mw:Citoid/Zotero's Tech Talk|Tech Talk by Sebastian Karcher]] for more information.

== Save/Publish ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[:mw:Editing|Editing]] team is planning to change the name of the [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] button to [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”]. “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” will be used when you create a new page. “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>” will be used when you change an existing page. The names will be consistent in all editing environments.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T131132][https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T139033]

This change will probably happen during the week of 30 August 2016. The change will be announced in [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/News|Tech News]] when it happens.

If you are fluent in a language other than English, please check the status of translations at translatewiki.net for [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”].

The main reason for this change is to avoid confusion for new editors. Repeated user research studies with new editors have shown that some new editors believed that [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] would save a private copy of a new page in their accounts, rather than permanently publishing their changes on the web. It is important for this part of the user interface to be clear, since it is difficult to remove public information after it is published. We believe that the confusion caused by the “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>” button increases the workload for experienced editors, who have to clean up the information that people unintentionally disclose, and report it to the functionaries and stewards to suppress it. Clarifying what the button does will reduce this problem.

Beyond that, the goal is to make all the wikis and languages more consistent, and some wikis made this change many years ago. The [[:m:Legal|Legal team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation supports this change. Making the edit interface easier to understand will make it easier to handle licensing and privacy questions that may arise. 

Any help pages or other basic documentation about how to edit pages will also need to be updated, on-wiki and elsewhere. On wiki pages, you can use the wikitext codes <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishpage}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishchanges}}</nowiki></code> to display the new labels in the user's preferred language. For the language settings in [[Special:Preferences|your account preferences]], these wikitext codes produce “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” and “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>”.

Please share this news with community members who teach new editors and with others who may be interested.
