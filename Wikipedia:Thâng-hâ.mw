The Wikimedia movement is beginning a movement-wide strategy discussion, a process which will run throughout 2017. For 15 years, Wikimedians have worked together to build the largest free knowledge resource in human history. During this time, we've grown from a small group of editors to a diverse network of editors, developers, affiliates, readers, donors, and partners. Today, we are more than a group of websites. We are a movement rooted in values and a powerful vision: all knowledge for all people. As a movement, we have an opportunity to decide where we go from here. 

This movement strategy discussion will focus on the future of our movement: where we want to go together, and what we want to achieve. We hope to design an inclusive process that makes space for everyone: editors, community leaders, affiliates, developers, readers, donors, technology platforms, institutional partners, and people we have yet to reach. There will be multiple ways to participate including on-wiki, in private spaces, and in-person meetings. You are warmly invited to join and make your voice heard.

The immediate goal is to have a strategic direction by Wikimania 2017 to help frame a discussion on how we work together toward that strategic direction.

Regular updates are being sent to the [[mail:Wikimedia-l|Wikimedia-l mailing list]], and posted [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Updates|on Meta-Wiki]]. Beginning with this message, monthly reviews of these updates will be sent to this page as well.

This version of the message is available for translation and documentation purposes'' 

Dear Wikimedians/Wikipedians:

Today we are starting a broad discussion to define Wikimedia's future role in the world and develop a collaborative strategy to fulfill that role. You are warmly invited to join the conversation.

There are many ways to participate, by joining an existing conversation or starting your own: 

[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Track_A|Track A (organized groups)]]: Discussions with your affiliate, committee or other organized group (these are groups that support the Wikimedia movement). 

Track B (individual contributors): [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_1|On Meta]] or your [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Participate|local language or project wiki]].

This is the first of three conversations, and it will run between now and April 15. The purpose of cycle 1 is to discuss the future of the movement and generate major themes around potential directions. What do we want to build or achieve together over the next 15 years?

We welcome you, as we create this conversation together, and look forward to broad and diverse participation from all parts of our movement.

''Please accept our apologies for cross-posting this message. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Updates/Start of the 2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees elections|This message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''
[[File:Wikimedia-logo black.svg|right|150px|link=m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017]]

On behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee, I am pleased to announce that self-nominations are being accepted for the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2017/Board_of_Trustees/Call_for_candidates|2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees Elections]].

The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] (Board) is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long-term sustainability of the Wikimedia Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection. More information about this role can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees|on Meta-Wiki]]. Please read the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Call for candidates|letter from the Board of Trustees calling for candidates]].

'''The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Candidates|candidacy submission phase]] will last from April 7 (00:00 UTC) to April 20 (23:59 UTC).'''

'''We will also be accepting questions to ask the candidates from April 7 to April 20. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Questions|You can submit your questions on Meta-Wiki]].'''

Once the questions submission period has ended on April 20, the Elections Committee will then collate the questions for the candidates to respond to beginning on April 21.

The goal of this process is to fill the '''three community-selected seats''' on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The election results will be used by the Board itself to select its new members.

The full schedule for the Board elections is as follows. All dates are '''inclusive''', that is, from the beginning of the first day (UTC) to the end of the last. 

* April 7 (00:00 UTC) – April 20 (23:59 UTC) – '''Board nominations''' 
* April 7 – April 20 – '''Board candidates questions submission period'''
* April 21 – April 30 – '''Board candidates answer questions'''
* May 1 – May 14 – '''Board voting period'''
* May 15–19 – '''Board vote checking'''
* May 20 – '''Board result announcement goal'''

In addition to the Board elections, we will also soon be holding elections for the following roles:

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)'''
** There are five positions being filled. More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee|on Meta-Wiki]].

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson (Ombuds)'''
** One position is being filled.  More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson|on Meta-Wiki]].

Please note that this year the Board of Trustees elections will be held before the FDC and Ombuds elections. Candidates who are not elected to the Board are explicitly permitted and encouraged to submit themselves as candidates to the FDC or Ombuds positions after the results of the Board elections are announced. 

More information on this year's elections can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|on Meta-Wiki]]. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|election talk page on Meta-Wiki]], or sent to the election committee's mailing list, <tt dir="ltr" style="white-space:nowrap;font-size:12px;line-height:1.5">board-elections[[File:At sign.svg|15x15px|middle|link=|alt=(at)]]wikimedia.org</tt>.

== Read-only mode for 20 to 30 minutes on 19 April and 3 May ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/Server switch 2017|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data center in Dallas.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 19 April 2017'''.
On '''Wednesday, 3 May 2017''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes on Wednesday, 19 April and Wednesday, 3 May. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170419T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 20 April and Thursday 4 May). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 17 April 2017 and 1 May 2017.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2017 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

== Wikidata description editing in the Wikipedia Android app ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|Wikidata description editing]] is a new experiment being rolled out on the Wikipedia app for Android.  While this primarily impacts Wikidata, the changes are also addressing a concern about the mobile versions of Wikipedia, so that mobile users will be able to edit directly the descriptions shown under the title of the page and in the search results.

We began by rolling out this feature several weeks ago  to a pilot group of Wikipedias (Russian, Hebrew, and Catalan), and have seen very positive [[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions/Research|results]] including numerous quality contributions in the form of new and updated descriptions, and a low rate of vandalism.

We are now ready for the next phase of rolling out this feature, which is to enable it in a few days for all Wikipedias except the top ten by usage within the app (i.e. except English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese). We will enable the feature for those languages instead at some point in the future, as we closely monitor user engagement with our expanded set of pilot communities.
As always, if have any concerns, please reach out to us on wiki at [[:mw:Talk:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|the talk page for this project]] or by email at reading@wikimedia.org. Thanks!

New Page previews feature

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/User:CKoerner (WMF)/Enable Hovercards/Phase 1|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

Hello,

The Reading web team at the Wikimedia Foundation has been working to enable [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Page previews]], [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|a beta feature]] known previously as Hovercards, as opt-in behavior for logged-in users and the default behavior for logged-out users across Wikipedia projects. Page previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. For this project, we are expecting to collect feedback over the following few weeks and tentatively enable the feature in early May, 2017.

A quick note on the implementation:

* For logged-in users who are not currently testing out the beta feature, Page previews will be off by default. Users may turn them on from [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|their user preferences]] page.
* For logged-out users, the feature will be on by default. Users may disable it at any time by selecting the setting cog available in each preview.
* For users of the Navigation popups gadget, you will not be able to turn on the Page previews feature while using navigational popups. If you would like to try out the Page preview feature, make sure to first turn Navigation popups off prior to turning Page previews on. 

You can read more about [[mw:Beta_Features/Hovercards|the feature]] and [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards#Success Metrics and Feature Evaluation|the tests we used to evaluate performance]], try it out by enabling it from the beta features page, and leave feedback or questions [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]].

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[:mediawikiwiki:2017_wikitext_editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]] which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and adding [[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|the new visual diff tool]]. Their workboard is available [[:phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at  [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].   Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[:mw:Beta Features|beta feature]], and improving the visual diff tool.   

=== Recent changes ===
*A '''new wikitext editing mode''' is available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices.  The [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]] has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  Go to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]] to enable the {{Int:Visualeditor-preference-newwikitexteditor-label}}. 
* A new '''[[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' is available in VisualEditor's visual mode.  You can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  More features will be added to this later.  In the future, this tool may be integrated into other MediaWiki components. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T143350]
* The team have added [[:mediawikiwiki:Editing/Projects/Columns_for_references|multi-column support for lists of footnotes]]. The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can automatically display long lists of references in columns on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.  You can [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Cite,VisualEditor,Wikimedia-Site-requests&title=Convert%20reference%20lists%20over%20to%20`responsive`%20on%20XXwiki&priority=10&parent=159895 '''request multi-column support'''] for your wiki. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T33597]
* You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356]
* The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-categories-tool}} item has been moved to the top of the {{Int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}} menu (from clicking on the "hamburger" icon) for quicker access. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74399] There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149009]
* You can now create <code><nowiki><chem></nowiki></code>  tags (sometimes used as <code><nowiki><ce></nowiki></code>) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153365]
* Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T157989]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-specialcharacter-button-tooltip}} menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, [[:S:en:User:Tpt|Tpt]]. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108626]
* A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T154217]
* There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> respectively. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299]

=== Future changes ===
* The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
* The kind of button used to {{Int:Showpreview}}, {{Int:showdiff}}, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use [[Mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]].  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849]
* The [[:mediawikiwiki:File:Edit_toolbar_-_2.png|outdated 2006 wikitext editor]] will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.  See [[:mw:Editor|a list of editing tools on mediawiki.org]] if you are uncertain which one you use.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T30856]

== Prototype for editing Wikidata infoboxes on Wikipedia ==

Hello,

I’m sorry for writing in English. It’d be great if someone could translate this message if necessary.

One of the most requested features for Wikidata is to enable editing of Wikidata’s data directly from Wikipedia, so the editors can continue their workflow without switching websites.

The Wikidata development team has been working on a tool to achieve this goal: '''fill and edit the Wikipedia infoboxes with information from Wikidata, directly on Wikipedia''', via the Visual Editor. 

We already [[d:Wikidata:Client editing input|asked for feedback in 2015]], and collected some interesting ideas which we [[:File:Facilitating_the_use_of_Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects_with_a_user-centered_design_approach.pdf|shared with you in this thesis]]. Now we would like to present to you our first prototype and collect your feedback, in order to improve and continue the development of this feature.

We present this work to you very early, so we can include your feedback before and all along the development. You are the core users of this feature, so we want to make sure that it fits your needs and editing processes.

You will find the prototype, description of the features, and a demo video, '''[[d:Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:Client editing prototype|on this page]]'''. Feel free to add any comment or feedback on the talk page. The page is currently not translated in every languages, but you can add your contribution by helping to translate it.

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to follow all the discussions on Wikipedia, so if you want to be sure that your feedback is read, please add it on the Wikidata page, in your favorite language. Thanks for your understanding.

Thanks, [[user:Lea Lacroix (WMDE)|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)]]

The RevisionSlider adds a slider view to the diff page so that you can easily move between revisions. The slider view is collapsed by default, and will load by clicking on it. It can also be turned off entirely in the user preferences. RevisionSlider has been a default feature on German, Arabic and Hebrew Wikipedia for 6 months and a beta feature on all wikis for 8 months. The feature fulfills a wish from the [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|German Community’s Technical Wishlist]]. Thanks to everyone who tested RevisionSlider and gave valuable feedback to improve the feature!

== New notification when a page is connected to Wikidata ==

Hello all,

''({{Int:Please-translate}})''

The Wikidata development team is about to deploy a new feature on all Wikipedias. It is a new type of notification (via Echo, the notification system you see at the top right of your wiki when you are logged in), that will inform the creator of a page, when this page is connected to a Wikidata item.

You may know that [[d:Wikidata:Main page|Wikidata]] provides a centralized system for all the interwikilinks. When a new page is created, it should be connected to the corresponding Wikidata item, by modifying this Wikidata item. With this new notification, editors creating pages will be informed when another editor connects this page to Wikidata.

[[File:Screenshot Echo Wikibase notification.png]]

This feature will be deployed on May 30th on all the Wikipedias, excepting English, French and German. This feature will be disable by default for existing editors, and enabled by default for new editors.

This is the first step of the deployments, the Wikipedias and other Wikimedia projects will follow in the next months.

If you have any question, suggestion, please let me know by pinging me. You can also follow and leave a comment [[phab:T142102|on the Phabricator ticket]].

Thanks go to [[d:user:Matěj Suchánek|Matěj Suchánek]] who developed this feature!

Hi, you are invited to participate in the discussion on the proposal to make a banner through [[m: centralnotice]] to inform more people around the world about what the Turkish government has done about Wikipedia, ie all the language versions of Wikipedia are You are obscured, so in Turkey it is impossible to view the * .wikipedia.org site. To hope that the Turkish government will remove the block, it is necessary to raise awareness of this fact around the world because it is important to succeed in this mission because Wikipedia can not be seen in Turkey.

== 一個提議 ==

大家好，我是粵文維基百科的編輯。我不懂客家語，所以只有用官話跟大家說話，十分抱歉。現時，我們粵文維基百科正在做一件項目，而這個項目我們相信極之有助保護粵語－所以我們認為其他非官話漢語維基百科也可以做相同的事來保護各自的語言。詳情如下：現在我們在自己的維基百科編寫一篇題為「嶺南文化」的文章，並把它翻譯成英文版「Lingnan culture」，其內容是討論粵式建築、粵式美術、粵式工藝、粵式戲曲等粵語地方文化，使我們廣府人能以自己的母語學習自己的地方文化以及向外國人介紹粵語文化。這是因為我們認為光是保護語言是不足夠的，我們還需要保護各語言的相應地方文化－語言是文化的載體，兩者密不可分，兩者都應同時保護，而且一定要用英語向全世界介紹我們的地方文化，才可以使國際社會認識我們。故此，我們建議你們分別用客家語和英語寫介紹客家文化的維基文章。如果你們想參考我們寫的文章，請到：

嶺南文化（粵語版）：https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org/wiki/嶺南文化

== Page Previews (Hovercards) update ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello,

A quick update on the progress of enabling [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]] (previously named Hovercards) on this project. Page Previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. As mentioned in December we're preparing to remove the feature from Beta and make it the default behavior for logged-out users. We have recently made a large update to the code which fixes most outstanding bugs. 

Due to some issues with our instrumentation, we delayed our deployment by a few months.  We are finally ready to deploy the feature.  Page Previews will be off by default and available in the user preferences page for logged-in users the week of July 24th. The feature will be on by default for current beta users and logged-out users. If you would like to preview the feature, you can enable it as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]]. For more information see [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]]. Questions can be left [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]] in your preferred language. 

Thank you again.

== Improved search in deleted pages archive ==

{{int:please-translate}}

During Wikimedia Hackathon 2016, the [[mw:Wikimedia_Discovery|Discovery]] team [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T109561 worked] on one of the items on the 2015 community wishlist, namely [[m:2015_Community_Wishlist_Survey/Search#Provide_a_means_of_searching_for_deleted_pages|enabling searching the archive of deleted pages]]. This feature is now ready for production deployment, and will be enabled on all wikis, except Wikidata. 

Right now, the feature is behind a feature flag - to use it on your wiki, please go to the <code>Special:Undelete</code> page, and add <code>&fuzzy=1</code> to the URL, like this: https://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AUndelete&fuzzy=1. Then search for the pages you're interested in. There should be more results than before, due to using ElasticSearch indexing (via the CirrusSearch extension).

We plan to enable this improved search by default on all wikis soon (around August 1, 2017). If you have any objections to this - please raise them with the Discovery team via [http://mailto:discovery@lists.wikimedia.org email] or on this announcement's discussion page. Like most Mediawiki configuration parameters, the functionality can be configured per wiki. 
Once the improved search becomes the default, you can still access the old mode using <code>&fuzzy=0</code> in the URL, like this: https://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AUndelete&fuzzy=0

Please note that since Special:Undelete is an admin-only feature, this search capability is also only accessible to wiki admins.

== RfC regarding "Interlinking of accounts involved with paid editing to decrease impersonation" ==

== Discussion on synced reading lists ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Discussion on synced reading lists'''

Hello,

[[File:Illustration of Reading List feature on Android Wikipedia App (not logged in).png|thumb]] The Reading Infrastructure team at the Wikimedia Foundation is developing a cross-platform reading list service for the mobile Wikipedia app. Reading lists are like bookmark folders in your web browser. They allow readers using the Wikipedia app to bookmark pages into folders to read later. This includes reading offline. Reading lists do not create or alter content in any way.  

To create Reading Lists, app users will register an account and marked pages will be tied to that account. Reading List account preferences sync between devices. You can read the same pages on different mobile platforms (tablets, phones).  This is the first time we are syncing preference data between devices in such a way. We want to hear and address concerns about privacy and data security. We also want to explain why the current watchlist system is not being adapted for this purpose. 
=== Background ===
In 2016 the Android team replaced the simple Saved Pages feature with Reading Lists. Reading Lists allow users to bookmark pages into folders and for reading offline. The intent of this feature was to allow "syncing" of these lists for users with many devices. Due to overlap with the Gather feature and related community concerns, this part was put on hold. 

The Android team has identified this lack of synching as a major area of complaint from users. They expect lists to sync. The iOS team has held off implementing Reading Lists, as syncing was seen as a "must have" for this feature. A recent [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T164990 technical RfC] has allowed these user stories and needs to be unblocked. Initially for Android, then iOS, and with web to potentially follow.

Reading lists are private, stored as part of a user's account, not as a public wiki page. There is no sharing or publishing ability for reading lists. No planned work to make these public. The target audience are people that read Wikipedia and want to bookmark and organize that content in the app. There is a potential for the feature to be available on the web in the future.

=== Why not watchlists ===

Watchlists offer similar functionality to Reading Lists. The Reading Infrastructure team evaluated watchlist infrastructure before exploring other options. In general, the needs of watchlists differ from Reading Lists in a few key ways:
* Reading lists focus on Reading articles, not the monitoring of changes.
* Watchlists are focused on monitoring changes of pages/revisions. 
** The Watchlist infrastructure is key to our contributor community for monitoring content changes manually and through the use of automated tools (bots). Because of these needs, expanding the scope of Watchlists to reading purposes will only make the project harder to maintain and add more constraints.
* By keeping the projects separate it is easier to scale resources. We can serve these two different audiences and prioritize the work accordingly. Reading Lists are, by their nature, less critical to the health of Wikipedia/MediaWiki.
* Multi-project support. Reading Lists are by design cross-wiki/project. Watchlists are tied to specific wikis. While there have been many discussion for making them cross-wiki, resolution is not in the near term.
[[mw:Wikimedia Apps/Synced Reading Lists|More information can be found on MediaWiki.org]] where feedback and ideas are welcome. 

Thank you

== New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers'''

The Readers web team will be deploying a new feature this week to make it [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|easier to download PDF versions of articles on the mobile website]].

Providing better offline functionality was one of the highlighted areas from [[m:New_Readers/Offline|the research done by the New Readers team in Mexico, Nigeria, and India]]. The teams created a prototype for mobile PDFs which was evaluated by user research and community feedback.  The [[m:New_Readers/Offline#Concept_testing_for_mobile_web|prototype evaluation]] received positive feedback and results, so development continued.

For the initial deployment, the feature will be available to Google Chrome browsers on Android. Support for other mobile browsers to come in the future. For Chrome, the feature will use the native Android print functionality. Users can choose to download a webpage as a PDF. [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles#Mobile_Printing|Mobile print styles]] will be used for these PDFs to ensure optimal readability for smaller screens.

The feature is available starting Wednesday, Nov 15. For more information, see [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|the project page on MediaWiki.org]].

'''Time to bring embedded maps (‘mapframe’) to most Wikipedias'''

{{int:please-translate}}

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Extension:Kartographer|Mapframe]] is a feature that enables users to easily display interactive maps right on wiki pages. Currently, most Wikipedias don’t have mapframe. But [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Maps#Milestones_and_Updates|fifteen Wikipedias]], along with all the other Wikimedia projects, are using mapframe today to display maps on thousands of pages.

A little background: over the last few months, the Foundation’s [[mw:Collaboration|Collaboration team]] has been working to improve the stability and user experience of the maps service. In addition, a question about long-term support for the maps service was recently settled, and a small team has been assigned for routine maintenance. Given these developments, bringing the benefits of mapframe to Wikipedias that lack the feature seems both safe and supportable. [[phab:T191583|Nine Wikipedias]] that use a stricter version of Flagged Revisions will not get mapframe in this release.

Maps are a valuable form of visual data that can improve readers’ understanding across a wide range of topics. If you know of any reasons why mapframe shouldn’t be implemented on your Wikipedia, let us know [[mw:Talk:Map_improvements_2018|on the project talk page]]. Unless we hear from you, we plan to release mapframe to most Wikipedias in May, 2018. So, if you foresee an issue, please let us hear from you. Otherwise, happy mapping!

== Update on page issues on mobile web ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Update on page issues on mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
Hi everyone. The [[mw:Reading/Web/Team|Readers web team]] has recently begun working on exposing issue templates on the mobile website. Currently, details about issues with page content are generally hidden on the mobile website. This leaves readers unaware of the reliability of the pages they are reading. The goal of this project is to improve awareness of particular issues within an article on the mobile web. We will do this by changing the visual styling of page issues.

So far, we have [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|drafted a proposal on the design and implementation]] of the project.  We were also able to run [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues/Research Results|user testing on the proposed designs]].  The tests so far have positive results. Here is a quick summary of what we learned:
* The new treatment increases awareness of page issues among participants. This is true particularly when they are in a more evaluative/critical mode.
* Page issues make sense to readers and they understand how they work
* Readers care about page issues and consider them important
* Readers had overwhelmingly positive sentiments towards Wikipedia associated with learning about page issues
Our next step would be to start implementing these changes. We wanted to reach out to you for any concerns, thoughts, and suggestions you might have before beginning development. Please [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|visit the project page]] where we have more information and mockups of how this may look. Please [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|leave feedback on the talk page]].

== Consultation on the creation of a separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''({{int:please-translate}})''

Hi all,

I'm preparing a change in who can edit sitewide CSS/JS pages. (These are pages like <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Common.css</code> and <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Vector.js</code> which are executed in the browser of all readers and editors.) Currently all administrators are able to edit these pages, which poses a serious and unnecessary security risk. Soon, a dedicated, smaller user group will take over this task. Your community will be able to decide who belongs in this group, so this should mean very little change for you. You can find out more and provide feedback at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|the consultation page on Meta]]. If you are involved in maintaining CSS/JS code, or policymaking around adminship requests, please give it a look!

Thanks!

== New user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''({{int:please-translate}})''

Hi all!

To improve the security of our readers and editors, permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed. (These are pages like <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Common.css</code> and <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Vector.js</code> which contain code that is executed in the browsers of users of the site.)
A new user group, <code dir="ltr">[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code>, has been created.
Starting four weeks from now, only members of this group will be able edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with <code dir="ltr">.css</code> or <code dir="ltr">.js</code> that is either in the <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:</code> namespace or is another user's user subpage).

You can learn more about the motivation behind the change [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|here]].

Please add users who need to edit CSS/JS to the new group (this can be done the same way new administrators are added, by stewards or local bureaucrats).
This is a dangerous permission; a malicious user or a hacker taking over the account of a careless interface-admin can abuse it in far worse ways than admin permissions could be abused. Please only assign it to users who need it, who are trusted by the community, and who follow common basic password and computer security practices (use strong passwords, do not reuse passwords, use two-factor authentication if possible, do not install software of questionable origin on your machine, use antivirus software if that's a standard thing in your environment).

Thanks!

== Enabling a helpful feature for Template editors ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hello.

The team working on TemplateStyles at the Wikimedia Foundation would like to enable TemplateStyles on this wiki.

TemplateStyles is a feature to allow non-administrators to write and manage CSS styles for templates. It allows contributors who edit templates to separate content and presentation. A good web practice that makes it easier to manage the layout of templates. If you don't edit templates, this will not have any impact on your contributions. 

TemplateStyles is useful for a few reasons. 

* It makes it possible for templates to work better on mobile.
* It cuts out confusion on where to apply CSS rules.
* Editing CSS is currently limited to administrators, which is a major barrier to participation.
* All stylesheets must be loaded on all pages (whether they actually use the page or not), which wastes bandwidth and makes debugging style rules more difficult.
You can [[mw:Help:TemplateStyles|learn more about TemplateStyles on MediaWiki.org]]. [[mw:Extension:TemplateStyles|Technical documentation is also available]].

This is an optional feature and no one must use it, but template contributors are encouraged to do so! Please discuss and let us know if there are any concerns. If there are no concerns we will proceed to deploy the feature on the 9th of August.

Thank you.

''({{int:please-translate}})''

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hi all,

as [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS/announcement 2|announced previously]], permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed: only members of the <code>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code> ({{int:group-interface-admin}}) group, and a few highly privileged global groups such as stewards, can edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with .css or .js that is either in the MediaWiki: namespace or is another user's user subpage). This is done to improve the security of readers and editors of Wikimedia projects. More information is available at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS]].

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 12 September 2018'''.
On '''Wednesday, 10 October 2018''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop when we switch.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Wednesday, 12 September and Wednesday, 10 October. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170503T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 13 September and Thursday 11 October). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 10 September 2018 and 8 October 2018.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2018 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

'''Change coming to how certain templates will appear on the mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
[[File:Page_issues_-_mobile_banner_example.jpg|thumb|Example of improvements]]

Hello,

In a few weeks the Readers web team will be changing how some templates look on the mobile web site. We will make these templates more noticeable when viewing the article. We ask for your help in updating any templates that don't look correct.

What kind of templates? Specifically templates that notify readers and contributors about issues with the content of an article – the text and information in the article. Examples like [[wikidata:Q5962027|Template:Unreferenced]] or [[Wikidata:Q5619503|Template:More citations needed]]. Right now these notifications are hidden behind a link under the title of an article. We will format templates like these (mostly those that use Template:Ambox or message box templates in general) to show a short summary under the page title. You can tap on the "Learn more" link to get more information.

For template editors we have [[mw:Recommendations_for_mobile_friendly_articles_on_Wikimedia_wikis#Making_page_issues_(ambox_templates)_mobile_friendly|some recommendations on how to make templates that are mobile-friendly]] and also further [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|documentation on our work so far]].

If you have questions about formatting templates for mobile, [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|please leave a note on the project talk page]] or [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Readers-Web-Backlog file a task in Phabricator] and we will help you.

It allows exports of files from a local wiki to Wikimedia Commons, including their file history and page history. Which files can be exported is defined by each wiki's community: '''Please check your wiki's [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons/Configuration file documentation|configuration file]]''' if you want to use this feature.

The FileExporter has already been a beta feature on [https://www.mediawiki.org mediawiki.org], [https://meta.wikimedia.org meta.wikimedia], deWP, faWP, arWP, koWP and on [https://wikisource.org wikisource.org]. After some functionality was added, it's now becoming a beta feature on all wikis. Deployment is planned for January 16. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|on the project page]]. 

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test the FileExporter, please activate it in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]].

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning a [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|global consultation about communication]]. The goal is to bring Wikimedians and wiki-minded people together to improve tools for communication.

We want all contributors to be able to talk to each other on the wikis, whatever their experience, their skills or their devices.

We are looking for input from as many different parts of the Wikimedia community as possible. It will come from multiple projects, in multiple languages, and with multiple perspectives.

We are currently planning the consultation. We need your help.

'''We need volunteers to help talk to their communities or user groups.'''

You can help by hosting a discussion at your wiki. Here's what to do:  
# First, [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Participant group sign-up|sign up your group here.]]  
# Next, create a page (or a section on a Village pump, or an e-mail thread – whatever is natural for your group) to collect information from other people in your group.  This is not a vote or decision-making discussion: we are just collecting feedback.  
# Then ask people what they think about communication processes.  We want to hear stories and other information about how people communicate with each other on and off wiki.  Please consider asking these five questions:
## When you want to discuss a topic with your community, what tools work for you, and what problems block you?
## What about talk pages works for newcomers, and what blocks them?
## What do others struggle with in your community about talk pages?
## What do you wish you could do on talk pages, but can't due to the technical limitations?
## What are the important aspects of a "wiki discussion"?
# Finally, please go to [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk pages consultation 2019 on Mediawiki.org]] and report what you learned from your group.  Please include links if the discussion is available to the public.

'''You can also help build the list of the many different ways people talk to each other.'''

Not all groups active on wikis or around wikis use the same way to discuss things: it can happen on wiki, on social networks, through external tools... Tell us [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Tools in use|how your group communicates]].

You can read more about [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|the overall process]] on mediawiki.org. If you have questions or ideas, you can [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|leave feedback about the consultation process]] in the language you prefer.
