== The visual editor is coming to this wiki ==

[[File:Norwegian-road-sign-110.0 (fluorescent).svg|right|frameless]]
''Hello again. Please excuse the English.  {{Int:Please-translate}}.  {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}''

<mark>[[mw:VisualEditor/Portal|'''The visual editor''']] is coming to all editors at this Wikipedia on Monday, 25 January.</mark> It allows people to edit Wikipedia articles as if they were using word processing software.  

You don't have to wait until the deployment to test it; '''you can test the visual editor right now.''' To turn it on, select [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|"Beta"]] in your preferences. Choose "{{int:visualeditor}}" and click save.  When it is enabled, you will press the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" button to edit an article in the new software. To use the wikitext editor, you can press "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}". 

After the deployment, everyone will automatically have the option to use either the visual editor or the current wikitext editor. For more information about how to use the visual editor, see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]]. 

More information about [[mediawikiwiki:Help:VisualEditor/VE_as_the_main_editor|preparing for the visual editor is posted here]].
* It's easier to add templates if you've added [[mw:TemplateData|TemplateData]] information. 
* Please help translate the user interface and pages about the visual editor. See [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|the visual editor's TranslationCentral]] for general information. To translate the user guide, go to [[mediawikiwiki:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|the MediaWiki.org page]], and select "{{int:translate-tag-translate-link-desc}}". Your language should be available from the drop-down menu on the right. Once you've done this, you'll see the document in English side by side with any translation work already done in your language. You can add new translations or change old translations.  To [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-visualeditor-0-all&language= translate the user interface], you need to create an account at translatewiki.net. Contact me personally if you need help with that.
* Please let us know if you find any problems. You can report issues in [[phab:|Phabricator, the new bug tracking system]] or on the [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|central feedback page]] on MediaWiki.org. If you notice major issues affecting your project, please leave a note [[:mw:User talk:Elitre (WMF)|on my talk page]].  In case of emergency (like an unexpected bug causing widespread problems), please contact James Forrester, the product manager, at jforrester@wikimedia.org or on [[:m:IRC|IRC]] in the #mediawiki-visualeditor channel.

== 2016 WMF Strategy consultation ==

:{{int:Please-translate}}
Hello, all.

The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) has launched a consultation to help create and prioritize WMF strategy beginning July 2016 and for the 12 to 24 months thereafter. This consultation will be open, on Meta, from 18 January to 26 February, after which the Foundation will also use these ideas to help inform its Annual Plan. (More on our timeline can be found on that Meta page.)

Your input is welcome (and greatly desired) at the Meta discussion, [[:m:2016 Strategy/Community consultation|2016 Strategy/Community consultation]].

Apologies for English, where this is posted on a non-English project. We thought it was more important to get the consultation translated as much as possible, and good headway has been made there in some languages. There is still much to do, however! We created [[:m:2016 Strategy/Translations]] to try to help coordinate what needs translation and what progress is being made. :)

If you have questions, please reach out to me on my talk page or on the strategy consultation's talk page or by email to mdennis@wikimedia.org.

I hope you'll join us! [[:m:User:Mdennis (WMF)|Maggie Dennis]] via [[用戶:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[用戶討論:MediaWiki message delivery|對話]]) 19:06, 18 一月 2016 (UTC)

Hello again (and again, apologies for using English on this page. {{Int:Please-translate}}.  {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}})

As some of you have noticed, '''this Wikipedia now has [[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal|the visual editor]] ({{int:visualeditor}}) enabled for all users'''.  (We planned to do this on 25 January 2016.  However, last week, there was an unusual problem with an upgrade to MediaWiki. Thanks for your understanding.) There are now two tabs for editing: "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}". Click "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" to use the visual editor. Click "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" to edit using wikitext markup.  

All edits using the visual editor will be tagged with "{{Int:tag-visualeditor}}" in recent changes, watchlists, and page histories.  To access the [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide|User Guide for the  visual editor]], click on the "(?)" icon in its toolbar.  If you wish to disable this new system, this can be done under [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing|"Editing" in your preferences]].  

Please let us know if you find any problems.  You can report issues in [[phab:|Phabricator, the new bug tracking system]] or on the [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|central feedback page]] on MediaWiki.org. 

<mark>If you can translate from English into this wiki's language, or know anyone who can, please follow the links on the "translation table" and help your community get the best possible experience when it comes to interface messages and documentation related to the visual editor.</mark> [[:mw:User talk:Elitre (WMF)|Please contact me directly]] whenever you need help!

Happy editing, [[:mw:User:Elitre (WMF)|Elitre (WMF)]] [[:mw:User talk:Elitre (WMF)|(talk)]] 17:21, 1 二月 2016 (UTC)

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

''[[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2016/February|Read this in another language]] • [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]''

<div style="margin:0.5em;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}border:1px solid #AAA;padding:0.5em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200x70px|center|alt=The visual editor]]

'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

Among experienced editors, the visual editor's table editing is one of the most popular features.
[[File:VisualEditor table menu move column.png|alt=Screenshot showing a pop-up menu for column operations in a table|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
If you select the top of a column or the end of a row, you can quickly insert and remove columns and rows.  

Now, you can also rearrange columns and rows. Click "Move before" or "Move after" to swap the column or row with its neighbor.
You can read and help translate [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Indic, and Han scripts, and improving the single edit tab interface.   

=== Recent changes ===
You can '''switch from the wikitext editor to the visual editor''' after you start editing. This function is available to nearly all editors at most wikis except the Wiktionaries and Wikisources.    

Many local '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor have been redirected to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].

You can now re-arrange columns and rows in '''tables''', as well as copying a row, column or any other selection of cells and pasting it in a new location.    

The '''formula editor''' has two options: you can choose "Quick edit" to see and change only the LaTeX code, or "Edit" to use the full tool. The full tool offers immediate preview and an extensive list of symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab. 
This is similar to the system already used on the mobile website. ([[phab:T102398|T102398]]) Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time. Your last editing choice will be stored as an account preference for logged-in editors, and as a cookie for logged-out users. Logged-in editors will have these options in the {{int:prefs-editing}} tab of [[Special:Preferences]]:   
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}},
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}},
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and
* {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}. (This is the state for people using the visual editor now.)
The visual editor uses the same search engine as [[Special:Search]] to find links and files. This search will get better at detecting typos and spelling mistakes soon. These improvements to search will appear in the visual editor as well.

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at most [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. This will affect the following languages, amongst others: 
[[:w:ja: |'''Japanese''']], [[:w:ko:|'''Korean''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']].
 
=== Let's work together ===
* Please try out the newest version of the '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' on [[test2wiki:Special:Random|test2.wikipedia.org]]. You may need to restore the default preferences (at the bottom of [[test2wiki:Special:Preferences]]) to see the initial prompt for options. Were you able to find a preference setting that will work for your own editing? Did you see [[:c:File:VisualEditor single edit tab preference dialog.png|the large preferences dialog box]] when you started editing an article there?  
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean, Arabic, Japanese, Indic, or Han scripts?</mark> Does typing in these languages feels natural in the visual editor? Language engineer [[:mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]] needs to know. Please see the instructions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test]] if you can help. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]].
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language! Join the [https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2016-February/084840.html Tech Talk about "Automated citations in Wikipedia: Citoid and the technology behind it"] with Sebastian Karcher on 29 February 2016.

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
== Updates to wiki search auto completion are arriving 10 March==

Hello!

{{Int:Please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}

The [[:m:User:CKoerner (WMF)/Work/Completion Suggester beta reminder and coming soon|completion suggester beta feature]] will become the default at the first group of wikis on '''Thursday, 10 March'''. This initial rollout will start with some of the smaller wikis to ensure the change happens in an organized way. The remaining wikis will receive the update on Wednesday, 16 March. This update brings three major improvements to search. Improved search result ordering, a tolerance for a small number of spelling errors, and suggests fewer typos.

Since December 2015, 19,000 editors have already opted into the completion suggester beta feature. Contributors are encouraged to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|try out the feature]] ahead of the release. Please share any comments on the Completion Suggester [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch/CompletionSuggester|discussion page]] in any language.

To learn more about the work of the Discovery department and other improvements to search, please check out [[wmfblog:2015/12/23/search-and-discovery-on-wikipedia/|the Wikimedia blog]].

== Server switch 2016 ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its newest data center in Dallas.
This will make sure Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.
To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems.

They will switch all traffic to the new data center on '''Tuesday, 19 April'''.<br/>
On '''Thursday, 21 April''', they will switch back to the primary data center.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.
We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future.

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 15 to 30 minutes on Tuesday, 19 April and Thursday, 21 April, starting at 14:00 UTC (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT).

If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.
We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.
If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.
Then you should be able to save your edit.
But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped.
Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal.
If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual.
Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be a code freeze for the week of 18 April.
No non-essential code deployments will take place.

This test was originally planned to take place on March 22.
April 19th and 21st are the new dates. 
You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for Q3 FY2015-2016 rollout|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]].
They will post any changes on that schedule.
There will be more notifications about this.

[[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). This will be enabled as a feature in the soon for all users, which can be turned on or off using a preference setting. We look forward to  your feedback and please do let us know if you have any questions. Details about Compact Language Links can be read in the [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project documentation]].

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. The main announcement can also be translated on [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links/Announcement_draft_June_2016|this page]]. Thank you. On behalf of the Wikimedia Language team: [[:mw:User:Runab_WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee (WMF)]] ([[mw:User talk:Runab_WMF|talk]])-13:06, 29 六月 2016 (UTC)

[[File:Compact-language-links-list.png|thumb|Screenshot of Compact Language Links interlanguage list]]

[[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). Based on several factors, this shorter list of languages is expected to be more relevant for them and valuable for finding similar content in a language known to them. More information about compact language links can be found in [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|the documentation]].

From today onwards, compact language links has been enabled as the default listing of interlanguage links on this wiki. However, using the button at the bottom, you will be able to see a longer list of all the languages the article has been written in. The setting for this compact list can be changed by using the checkbox under ''User Preferences -> Appearance -> Languages''

The compact language links feature has been tested extensively by the Wikimedia Language team, which developed it. However, in case there are any problems or other feedback please let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project talk page]]. It is to be noted that on some wikis the presence of an existing older gadget that was used for a similar purpose may cause an interference for compact language list. We would like to bring this to the attention of the admins of this wiki. Full details are on [[phab:T131455|this phabricator ticket]] (in English).

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. Thank you.

== Wikipedia to the Moon: invitation to edit ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Three weeks ago, you were invited to vote on how to take Wikipedia articles to the Moon. Community voting is over and the winning idea is to send all ‘’featured articles and lists’’ to the Moon. This decision means that, starting today, Wikipedians from all language communities are warmly invited to intensively work on their best articles and lists, and submit them to Wikipedia to the Moon. The central site to coordinate between communities will be Meta-Wiki. You will find an [[m:Wikipedia to the Moon/Working|overview and more information there]]. Hopefully, we will be able to represent as many languages as possible, to show Wikipedia’s diversity. Please feel kindly invited to edit on behalf of your community and tell us about your work on featured content!

Best, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia to the Moon/About|Moon team at Wikimedia Deutschland]] 14:10, 1 七月 2016 (UTC)

== Editing News #2—2016 ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Newsletter/2016/June|Read this in another language]] • [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]''

<div style="float:right;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}margin-left:1em;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:1em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200px|center|alt=VisualEditor]]'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

It's quick and easy to insert a references list.
[[File:VisualEditor References List Insert Menu-en.png|alt=Screenshot showing a dropdown menu with many items|center|frameless|150px]]  

Place the cursor where you want to display the references list (usually at the bottom of the page).  Open the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu and click the "{{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}" icon (three books).

If you are using several groups of references, which is relatively rare, you will have the opportunity to specify the group. If you do that, then only the references that belong to the specified group will be displayed in this list of references.
Finally, click "{{int:visualeditor-dialog-action-insert}}" in the dialog to insert the {{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}.  This list will change as you add more footnotes to the page.

You can read and help translate [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Arabic and Indic scripts, and adapting the visual editor to the needs of the Wikivoyages and Wikisources.   

=== Recent changes ===
The visual editor is now available to all users at most [[Wikivoyage:|Wikivoyages]].  It was also enabled for all contributors at the French Wikinews.

The '''[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' feature combines the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab.  It has been deployed to several Wikipedias, including Hungarian, Polish, English and Japanese Wikipedias, as well as to all Wikivoyages.  At these wikis, you can change your settings for this feature in the "{{int:prefs-editing}}" tab of [[Special:Preferences]]. The team is now reviewing the feedback and considering ways to improve the design before rolling it out to more people.

=== Future changes ===
The "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".   This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[M:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the remaining [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. The developers want to know whether typing in your language feels natural in the visual editor. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]]. This will affect several languages, including: [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']] and others.

The team is working with the volunteer developers who power Wikisource to provide the visual editor there, for opt-in testing right now and eventually for all users. ([[phab:T138966|T138966]]) 

The team is working on a modern wikitext editor.  It will look like the visual editor, and be able to use the citoid service and other modern tools.  This new editing system may become available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices around September 2016.  You can read about this project in a [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Roadmap/Update_2016-06-23|general status update on the Wikimedia mailing list]]. 

=== Let's work together ===
* Do you teach new editors how to use the visual editor? Did you help [[:mw:Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]]? Have you written or imported [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your most important citation templates?  <mark>Would you be willing to help new editors and small communities with the visual editor?  Please sign up for the new [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/Community Taskforce|'''VisualEditor Community Taskforce''']].</mark>
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[w:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language!  Watch the [[Mw:Citoid/Zotero's Tech Talk|Tech Talk by Sebastian Karcher]] for more information.

== Save/Publish ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[:mw:Editing|Editing]] team is planning to change the name of the [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] button to [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”]. “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” will be used when you create a new page. “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>” will be used when you change an existing page. The names will be consistent in all editing environments.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T131132][https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T139033]

This change will probably happen during the week of 30 August 2016. The change will be announced in [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/News|Tech News]] when it happens.

If you are fluent in a language other than English, please check the status of translations at translatewiki.net for [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”].

The main reason for this change is to avoid confusion for new editors. Repeated user research studies with new editors have shown that some new editors believed that [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] would save a private copy of a new page in their accounts, rather than permanently publishing their changes on the web. It is important for this part of the user interface to be clear, since it is difficult to remove public information after it is published. We believe that the confusion caused by the “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>” button increases the workload for experienced editors, who have to clean up the information that people unintentionally disclose, and report it to the functionaries and stewards to suppress it. Clarifying what the button does will reduce this problem.

Beyond that, the goal is to make all the wikis and languages more consistent, and some wikis made this change many years ago. The [[:m:Legal|Legal team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation supports this change. Making the edit interface easier to understand will make it easier to handle licensing and privacy questions that may arise. 

Any help pages or other basic documentation about how to edit pages will also need to be updated, on-wiki and elsewhere. On wiki pages, you can use the wikitext codes <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishpage}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishchanges}}</nowiki></code> to display the new labels in the user's preferred language. For the language settings in [[Special:Preferences|your account preferences]], these wikitext codes produce “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” and “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>”.

Please share this news with community members who teach new editors and with others who may be interested.

We are having a problem with attackers taking over wiki accounts with privileged user rights (for example, admins, bureaucrats, oversighters, checkusers). It appears that this may be because of weak or reused passwords.

Community members are working along with members of multiple teams at the Wikimedia Foundation to address this issue.

In the meantime, we ask that everyone takes a look at the passwords they have chosen for their wiki accounts. If you know that you've chosen a weak password, or if you've chosen a password that you are using somewhere else, please change those passwords.

Select strong passwords – eight or more characters long, and containing letters, numbers, and punctuation.

== New way to edit wikitext ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

'''Summary''': There's a new opt-in Beta Feature of a [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|wikitext mode for the visual editor]]. Please [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|go try it out]].


We in the Wikimedia Foundation's Editing department are responsible for making editing better for all our editors, new and experienced alike. We've been slowly improving [[:mw:VisualEditor|the visual editor]] based on feedback, user tests, and feature requests. However, that doesn't work for all our user needs: whether you need to edit a wikitext talk page, create a template, or fix some broken reference syntax, sometimes you need to use wikitext, and many experienced editors prefer it.

Consequently, we've planned a "wikitext mode" for the visual editor for a long time. It provides as much of the visual editor's features as possible, for those times that you need or want wikitext. It has the same user interface as the visual editor, including the same toolbar across the top with the same buttons. It provides access to the [[:mw:citoid|citoid service]] for formatting citations, integrated search options for inserting images, and the ability to add new templates in a simple dialog. Like in the visual editor, if you paste in formatted text copied from another page, then formatting (such as bolding) will automatically be converted into wikitext.

All wikis now have access to this mode as a [[:mw:Beta Features|Beta Feature]]. When enabled, it replaces your existing [[:mw:Editor|wikitext editor]] everywhere. If you don't like it, you can reverse this at any time by turning off the Beta Feature in your preferences. We don't want to surprise anyone, so it's strictly an ''opt-in-only'' Beta Feature. It won't switch on automatically for anyone, even if you have previously checked the box to "{{Int:Betafeatures-auto-enroll}}".

The new wikitext edit mode is based on the visual editor, so it requires JavaScript (as does the [[:mw:Extension:WikiEditor|current wikitext editor]]). It doesn't work with gadgets that have only been designed for the older one (and ''vice versa''), so some users will miss gadgets they find important. We're happy to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Gadgets|work with gadget authors to help them update their code to work]] with both editors. We're not planning to get rid of the current main wikitext editor on desktop in the foreseeable future. We're also not going to remove the existing ability to edit plain wikitext without JavaScript. Finally, though it should go without saying, if you prefer to continue using the current wikitext editor, then you may so do.

This is an early version, and we'd love to know what you think so we can make it better. Please leave feedback about the new mode [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor/Feedback|on the feedback page]].  You may write comments in any language.  Thank you.

== Review of initial updates on Wikimedia movement strategy process ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''Note: Apologies for cross-posting and sending in English. [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2017/Updates/Initial announcements review|Message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''

The Wikimedia movement is beginning a movement-wide strategy discussion, a process which will run throughout 2017. For 15 years, Wikimedians have worked together to build the largest free knowledge resource in human history. During this time, we've grown from a small group of editors to a diverse network of editors, developers, affiliates, readers, donors, and partners. Today, we are more than a group of websites. We are a movement rooted in values and a powerful vision: all knowledge for all people. As a movement, we have an opportunity to decide where we go from here. 

This movement strategy discussion will focus on the future of our movement: where we want to go together, and what we want to achieve. We hope to design an inclusive process that makes space for everyone: editors, community leaders, affiliates, developers, readers, donors, technology platforms, institutional partners, and people we have yet to reach. There will be multiple ways to participate including on-wiki, in private spaces, and in-person meetings. You are warmly invited to join and make your voice heard.

The immediate goal is to have a strategic direction by Wikimania 2017 to help frame a discussion on how we work together toward that strategic direction.

Regular updates are being sent to the [[mail:Wikimedia-l|Wikimedia-l mailing list]], and posted [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Updates|on Meta-Wiki]].

Dear Wikimedians/Wikipedians:

Today we are starting a broad discussion to define Wikimedia's future role in the world and develop a collaborative strategy to fulfill that role. You are warmly invited to join the conversation.

There are many ways to participate, by joining an existing conversation or starting your own: 

[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Track_A|Track A (organized groups)]]: Discussions with your affiliate, committee or other organized group (these are groups that support the Wikimedia movement). 

Track B (individual contributors): [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_1|On Meta]] or your [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Participate|local language or project wiki]].

This is the first of three conversations, and it will run between now and April 15. The purpose of cycle 1 is to discuss the future of the movement and generate major themes around potential directions. What do we want to build or achieve together over the next 15 years?

We welcome you, as we create this conversation together, and look forward to broad and diverse participation from all parts of our movement.

''Please accept our apologies for cross-posting this message. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Updates/Start of the 2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees elections|This message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''
[[File:Wikimedia-logo black.svg|right|150px|link=m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017]]

On behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee, I am pleased to announce that self-nominations are being accepted for the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2017/Board_of_Trustees/Call_for_candidates|2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees Elections]].

The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] (Board) is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long-term sustainability of the Wikimedia Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection. More information about this role can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees|on Meta-Wiki]]. Please read the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Call for candidates|letter from the Board of Trustees calling for candidates]].

'''The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Candidates|candidacy submission phase]] will last from April 7 (00:00 UTC) to April 20 (23:59 UTC).'''

'''We will also be accepting questions to ask the candidates from April 7 to April 20. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Questions|You can submit your questions on Meta-Wiki]].'''

Once the questions submission period has ended on April 20, the Elections Committee will then collate the questions for the candidates to respond to beginning on April 21.

The goal of this process is to fill the '''three community-selected seats''' on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The election results will be used by the Board itself to select its new members.

The full schedule for the Board elections is as follows. All dates are '''inclusive''', that is, from the beginning of the first day (UTC) to the end of the last. 

* April 7 (00:00 UTC) – April 20 (23:59 UTC) – '''Board nominations''' 
* April 7 – April 20 – '''Board candidates questions submission period'''
* April 21 – April 30 – '''Board candidates answer questions'''
* May 1 – May 14 – '''Board voting period'''
* May 15–19 – '''Board vote checking'''
* May 20 – '''Board result announcement goal'''

In addition to the Board elections, we will also soon be holding elections for the following roles:

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)'''
** There are five positions being filled. More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee|on Meta-Wiki]].

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson (Ombuds)'''
** One position is being filled.  More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson|on Meta-Wiki]].

Please note that this year the Board of Trustees elections will be held before the FDC and Ombuds elections. Candidates who are not elected to the Board are explicitly permitted and encouraged to submit themselves as candidates to the FDC or Ombuds positions after the results of the Board elections are announced. 

More information on this year's elections can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|on Meta-Wiki]]. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|election talk page on Meta-Wiki]], or sent to the election committee's mailing list, <tt dir="ltr" style="white-space:nowrap;font-size:12px;line-height:1.5">board-elections[[File:At sign.svg|15x15px|middle|link=|alt=(at)]]wikimedia.org</tt>.

== Read-only mode for 20 to 30 minutes on 19 April and 3 May ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/Server switch 2017|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data center in Dallas.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 19 April 2017'''.
On '''Wednesday, 3 May 2017''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes on Wednesday, 19 April and Wednesday, 3 May. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170419T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 20 April and Thursday 4 May). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 17 April 2017 and 1 May 2017.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2017 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

== Wikidata description editing in the Wikipedia Android app ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|Wikidata description editing]] is a new experiment being rolled out on the Wikipedia app for Android.  While this primarily impacts Wikidata, the changes are also addressing a concern about the mobile versions of Wikipedia, so that mobile users will be able to edit directly the descriptions shown under the title of the page and in the search results.

We began by rolling out this feature several weeks ago  to a pilot group of Wikipedias (Russian, Hebrew, and Catalan), and have seen very positive [[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions/Research|results]] including numerous quality contributions in the form of new and updated descriptions, and a low rate of vandalism.

We are now ready for the next phase of rolling out this feature, which is to enable it in a few days for all Wikipedias except the top ten by usage within the app (i.e. except English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese). We will enable the feature for those languages instead at some point in the future, as we closely monitor user engagement with our expanded set of pilot communities.
As always, if have any concerns, please reach out to us on wiki at [[:mw:Talk:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|the talk page for this project]] or by email at reading@wikimedia.org. Thanks!

New Page previews feature

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/User:CKoerner (WMF)/Enable Hovercards/Phase 1|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

Hello,

The Reading web team at the Wikimedia Foundation has been working to enable [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Page previews]], [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|a beta feature]] known previously as Hovercards, as opt-in behavior for logged-in users and the default behavior for logged-out users across Wikipedia projects. Page previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. For this project, we are expecting to collect feedback over the following few weeks and tentatively enable the feature in early May, 2017.

A quick note on the implementation:

* For logged-in users who are not currently testing out the beta feature, Page previews will be off by default. Users may turn them on from [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|their user preferences]] page.
* For logged-out users, the feature will be on by default. Users may disable it at any time by selecting the setting cog available in each preview.
* For users of the Navigation popups gadget, you will not be able to turn on the Page previews feature while using navigational popups. If you would like to try out the Page preview feature, make sure to first turn Navigation popups off prior to turning Page previews on. 

You can read more about [[mw:Beta_Features/Hovercards|the feature]] and [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards#Success Metrics and Feature Evaluation|the tests we used to evaluate performance]], try it out by enabling it from the beta features page, and leave feedback or questions [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]].

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[:mediawikiwiki:2017_wikitext_editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]] which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and adding [[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|the new visual diff tool]].

You can find links to the work finished each week at  [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].   Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[:mw:Beta Features|beta feature]], and improving the visual diff tool.   

=== Recent changes ===
*A '''new wikitext editing mode''' is available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices.  The [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]] has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  Go to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]] to enable the {{Int:Visualeditor-preference-newwikitexteditor-label}}. 
* A new '''[[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' is available in VisualEditor's visual mode.  You can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  More features will be added to this later.  In the future, this tool may be integrated into other MediaWiki components. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T143350]
* The team have added [[:mediawikiwiki:Editing/Projects/Columns_for_references|multi-column support for lists of footnotes]]. The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can automatically display long lists of references in columns on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.  You can [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Cite,VisualEditor,Wikimedia-Site-requests&title=Convert%20reference%20lists%20over%20to%20`responsive`%20on%20XXwiki&priority=10&parent=159895 '''request multi-column support'''] for your wiki. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T33597]
* You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356]
* The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-categories-tool}} item has been moved to the top of the {{Int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}} menu (from clicking on the "hamburger" icon) for quicker access. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74399] There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149009]
* You can now create <code><nowiki><chem></nowiki></code>  tags (sometimes used as <code><nowiki><ce></nowiki></code>) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153365]
* Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T157989]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-specialcharacter-button-tooltip}} menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, [[:S:en:User:Tpt|Tpt]]. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108626]
* A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T154217]
* There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> respectively. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299]

=== Future changes ===
* The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
* The kind of button used to {{Int:Showpreview}}, {{Int:showdiff}}, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use [[Mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]].  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849]
* The [[:mediawikiwiki:File:Edit_toolbar_-_2.png|outdated 2006 wikitext editor]] will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.  See [[:mw:Editor|a list of editing tools on mediawiki.org]] if you are uncertain which one you use.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T30856]

== Prototype for editing Wikidata infoboxes on Wikipedia ==

Hello,

I’m sorry for writing in English. It’d be great if someone could translate this message if necessary.

One of the most requested features for Wikidata is to enable editing of Wikidata’s data directly from Wikipedia, so the editors can continue their workflow without switching websites.

The Wikidata development team has been working on a tool to achieve this goal: '''fill and edit the Wikipedia infoboxes with information from Wikidata, directly on Wikipedia''', via the Visual Editor. 

We already [[d:Wikidata:Client editing input|asked for feedback in 2015]], and collected some interesting ideas which we [[:File:Facilitating_the_use_of_Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects_with_a_user-centered_design_approach.pdf|shared with you in this thesis]]. Now we would like to present to you our first prototype and collect your feedback, in order to improve and continue the development of this feature.

We present this work to you very early, so we can include your feedback before and all along the development. You are the core users of this feature, so we want to make sure that it fits your needs and editing processes.

You will find the prototype, description of the features, and a demo video, '''[[d:Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:Client editing prototype|on this page]]'''. Feel free to add any comment or feedback on the talk page. The page is currently not translated in every languages, but you can add your contribution by helping to translate it.

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to follow all the discussions on Wikipedia, so if you want to be sure that your feedback is read, please add it on the Wikidata page, in your favorite language. Thanks for your understanding.

Thanks, [[user:Lea Lacroix (WMDE)|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)]]

It can also be turned off entirely in the user preferences. RevisionSlider has been a default feature on German, Arabic and Hebrew Wikipedia for 6 months and a beta feature on all wikis for 8 months.

== New notification when a page is connected to Wikidata ==

Hello all,

''({{Int:Please-translate}})''

The Wikidata development team is about to deploy a new feature on all Wikipedias. It is a new type of notification (via Echo, the notification system you see at the top right of your wiki when you are logged in), that will inform the creator of a page, when this page is connected to a Wikidata item.

You may know that [[d:Wikidata:Main page|Wikidata]] provides a centralized system for all the interwikilinks. When a new page is created, it should be connected to the corresponding Wikidata item, by modifying this Wikidata item. With this new notification, editors creating pages will be informed when another editor connects this page to Wikidata.

[[File:Screenshot Echo Wikibase notification.png]]

This feature will be deployed on May 30th on all the Wikipedias, excepting English, French and German. This feature will be disable by default for existing editors, and enabled by default for new editors.

This is the first step of the deployments, the Wikipedias and other Wikimedia projects will follow in the next months.

If you have any question, suggestion, please let me know by pinging me. You can also follow and leave a comment [[phab:T142102|on the Phabricator ticket]].

Thanks go to [[d:user:Matěj Suchánek|Matěj Suchánek]] who developed this feature!

Hi, you are invited to participate in the discussion on the proposal to make a banner through [[m: centralnotice]] to inform more people around the world about what the Turkish government has done about Wikipedia, ie all the language versions of Wikipedia are You are obscured, so in Turkey it is impossible to view the * .wikipedia.org site.

== 一個提議 ==

大家好，我是粵文維基百科的編輯。我不懂客家語，所以只有用官話跟大家說話，十分抱歉。現時，我們粵文維基百科正在做一件項目，而這個項目我們相信極之有助保護粵語－所以我們認為其他非官話漢語維基百科也可以做相同的事來保護各自的語言。詳情如下：現在我們在自己的維基百科編寫一篇題為「嶺南文化」的文章，並把它翻譯成英文版「Lingnan culture」，其內容是討論粵式建築、粵式美術、粵式工藝、粵式戲曲等粵語地方文化，使我們廣府人能以自己的母語學習自己的地方文化以及向外國人介紹粵語文化。這是因為我們認為光是保護語言是不足夠的，我們還需要保護各語言的相應地方文化－語言是文化的載體，兩者密不可分，兩者都應同時保護，而且一定要用英語向全世界介紹我們的地方文化，才可以使國際社會認識我們。故此，我們建議你們分別用客家語和英語寫介紹客家文化的維基文章。如果你們想參考我們寫的文章，請到：

嶺南文化（粵語版）：https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org/wiki/嶺南文化

== Page Previews (Hovercards) update ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello,

A quick update on the progress of enabling [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]] (previously named Hovercards) on this project. Page Previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. As mentioned in December we're preparing to remove the feature from Beta and make it the default behavior for logged-out users. We have recently made a large update to the code which fixes most outstanding bugs. 

Due to some issues with our instrumentation, we delayed our deployment by a few months.  We are finally ready to deploy the feature.  Page Previews will be off by default and available in the user preferences page for logged-in users the week of July 24th. The feature will be on by default for current beta users and logged-out users. If you would like to preview the feature, you can enable it as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]]. For more information see [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]]. Questions can be left [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]] in your preferred language. 

Thank you again.

== Improved search in deleted pages archive ==

{{int:please-translate}}

During Wikimedia Hackathon 2016, the [[mw:Wikimedia_Discovery|Discovery]] team [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T109561 worked] on one of the items on the 2015 community wishlist, namely [[m:2015_Community_Wishlist_Survey/Search#Provide_a_means_of_searching_for_deleted_pages|enabling searching the archive of deleted pages]]. This feature is now ready for production deployment, and will be enabled on all wikis, except Wikidata. 

Right now, the feature is behind a feature flag - to use it on your wiki, please go to the <code>Special:Undelete</code> page, and add <code>&fuzzy=1</code> to the URL, like this: https://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AUndelete&fuzzy=1. Then search for the pages you're interested in. There should be more results than before, due to using ElasticSearch indexing (via the CirrusSearch extension).

We plan to enable this improved search by default on all wikis soon (around August 1, 2017). If you have any objections to this - please raise them with the Discovery team via [http://mailto:discovery@lists.wikimedia.org email] or on this announcement's discussion page. Like most Mediawiki configuration parameters, the functionality can be configured per wiki. 
Once the improved search becomes the default, you can still access the old mode using <code>&fuzzy=0</code> in the URL, like this: https://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AUndelete&fuzzy=0

Please note that since Special:Undelete is an admin-only feature, this search capability is also only accessible to wiki admins.

== Discussion on synced reading lists ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Discussion on synced reading lists'''

Hello,

[[File:Illustration of Reading List feature on Android Wikipedia App (not logged in).png|thumb]] The Reading Infrastructure team at the Wikimedia Foundation is developing a cross-platform reading list service for the mobile Wikipedia app. Reading lists are like bookmark folders in your web browser. They allow readers using the Wikipedia app to bookmark pages into folders to read later. This includes reading offline. Reading lists do not create or alter content in any way.  

To create Reading Lists, app users will register an account and marked pages will be tied to that account. Reading List account preferences sync between devices. You can read the same pages on different mobile platforms (tablets, phones).  This is the first time we are syncing preference data between devices in such a way. We want to hear and address concerns about privacy and data security. We also want to explain why the current watchlist system is not being adapted for this purpose. 
=== Background ===
In 2016 the Android team replaced the simple Saved Pages feature with Reading Lists. Reading Lists allow users to bookmark pages into folders and for reading offline. The intent of this feature was to allow "syncing" of these lists for users with many devices. Due to overlap with the Gather feature and related community concerns, this part was put on hold. 

The Android team has identified this lack of synching as a major area of complaint from users. They expect lists to sync. The iOS team has held off implementing Reading Lists, as syncing was seen as a "must have" for this feature. A recent [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T164990 technical RfC] has allowed these user stories and needs to be unblocked. Initially for Android, then iOS, and with web to potentially follow.

Reading lists are private, stored as part of a user's account, not as a public wiki page. There is no sharing or publishing ability for reading lists. No planned work to make these public. The target audience are people that read Wikipedia and want to bookmark and organize that content in the app. There is a potential for the feature to be available on the web in the future.

=== Why not watchlists ===

Watchlists offer similar functionality to Reading Lists. The Reading Infrastructure team evaluated watchlist infrastructure before exploring other options. In general, the needs of watchlists differ from Reading Lists in a few key ways:
* Reading lists focus on Reading articles, not the monitoring of changes.
* Watchlists are focused on monitoring changes of pages/revisions. 
** The Watchlist infrastructure is key to our contributor community for monitoring content changes manually and through the use of automated tools (bots). Because of these needs, expanding the scope of Watchlists to reading purposes will only make the project harder to maintain and add more constraints.
* By keeping the projects separate it is easier to scale resources. We can serve these two different audiences and prioritize the work accordingly. Reading Lists are, by their nature, less critical to the health of Wikipedia/MediaWiki.
* Multi-project support. Reading Lists are by design cross-wiki/project. Watchlists are tied to specific wikis. While there have been many discussion for making them cross-wiki, resolution is not in the near term.
[[mw:Wikimedia Apps/Synced Reading Lists|More information can be found on MediaWiki.org]] where feedback and ideas are welcome. 

Thank you

== New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers'''

The Readers web team will be deploying a new feature this week to make it [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|easier to download PDF versions of articles on the mobile website]].

Providing better offline functionality was one of the highlighted areas from [[m:New_Readers/Offline|the research done by the New Readers team in Mexico, Nigeria, and India]]. The teams created a prototype for mobile PDFs which was evaluated by user research and community feedback.  The [[m:New_Readers/Offline#Concept_testing_for_mobile_web|prototype evaluation]] received positive feedback and results, so development continued.

For the initial deployment, the feature will be available to Google Chrome browsers on Android. Support for other mobile browsers to come in the future. For Chrome, the feature will use the native Android print functionality. Users can choose to download a webpage as a PDF. [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles#Mobile_Printing|Mobile print styles]] will be used for these PDFs to ensure optimal readability for smaller screens.

The feature is available starting Wednesday, Nov 15. For more information, see [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|the project page on MediaWiki.org]].

'''Time to bring embedded maps (‘mapframe’) to most Wikipedias'''

{{int:please-translate}}

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Extension:Kartographer|Mapframe]] is a feature that enables users to easily display interactive maps right on wiki pages. Currently, most Wikipedias don’t have mapframe. But [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Maps#Milestones_and_Updates|fifteen Wikipedias]], along with all the other Wikimedia projects, are using mapframe today to display maps on thousands of pages.

A little background: over the last few months, the Foundation’s [[mw:Collaboration|Collaboration team]] has been working to improve the stability and user experience of the maps service. In addition, a question about long-term support for the maps service was recently settled, and a small team has been assigned for routine maintenance. Given these developments, bringing the benefits of mapframe to Wikipedias that lack the feature seems both safe and supportable. [[phab:T191583|Nine Wikipedias]] that use a stricter version of Flagged Revisions will not get mapframe in this release.

Maps are a valuable form of visual data that can improve readers’ understanding across a wide range of topics. If you know of any reasons why mapframe shouldn’t be implemented on your Wikipedia, let us know [[mw:Talk:Map_improvements_2018|on the project talk page]]. Unless we hear from you, we plan to release mapframe to most Wikipedias in May, 2018. So, if you foresee an issue, please let us hear from you. Otherwise, happy mapping!

== Update on page issues on mobile web ==

'''Update on page issues on mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
Hi everyone. The [[mw:Reading/Web/Team|Readers web team]] has recently begun working on exposing issue templates on the mobile website. Currently, details about issues with page content are generally hidden on the mobile website. This leaves readers unaware of the reliability of the pages they are reading. The goal of this project is to improve awareness of particular issues within an article on the mobile web. We will do this by changing the visual styling of page issues.

So far, we have [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|drafted a proposal on the design and implementation]] of the project.  We were also able to run [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues/Research Results|user testing on the proposed designs]].  The tests so far have positive results. Here is a quick summary of what we learned:
* The new treatment increases awareness of page issues among participants. This is true particularly when they are in a more evaluative/critical mode.
* Page issues make sense to readers and they understand how they work
* Readers care about page issues and consider them important
* Readers had overwhelmingly positive sentiments towards Wikipedia associated with learning about page issues
Our next step would be to start implementing these changes. We wanted to reach out to you for any concerns, thoughts, and suggestions you might have before beginning development. Please [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|visit the project page]] where we have more information and mockups of how this may look. Please [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|leave feedback on the talk page]].
