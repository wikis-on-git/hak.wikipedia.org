== Be a Wikimedia fundraising "User Experience" volunteer! ==

Thank you to everyone who volunteered last year on the Wikimedia fundraising 'User Experience' project. We have talked to many different people in different countries and their feedback has helped us immensely in restructuring our pages. If you haven't heard of it yet, the 'User Experience' project has the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries (outside the USA) and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. 

I am (still) searching for volunteers to spend some time on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 

The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. **All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed (and they will be very low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)**

By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!!

Thanks!

== Wikimedia sites to move to primary data center in Ashburn, Virginia. Read-only mode expected. ==

(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) Next week, the Wikimedia Foundation will transition its main technical operations to a new data center in Ashburn, Virginia, USA. This is intended to improve the technical performance and reliability of all Wikimedia sites, including this wiki. There will be some times when the site will be in read-only mode, and there may be full outages; the current target windows for the migration are January 22nd, 23rd and 24th, 2013, from 17:00 to 01:00 UTC (see [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Wikimedia+data+center+migration&iso=20130122T17&ah=8 other timezones] on timeanddate.com). More information is available [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/01/19/wikimedia-sites-move-to-primary-data-center-in-ashburn-virginia/ in the full announcement].

If you would like to stay informed of future technical upgrades, consider [[m:Tech/Ambassadors|becoming a Tech ambassador]] and [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-ambassadors joining the ambassadors mailing list]. You will be able to help your fellow Wikimedians have a voice in technical discussions and be notified of important decisions.

Thank you for your help and your understanding.

== Wikidata phase 1 (language links) coming to this Wikipedia ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this locally.

[[d:|Wikidata]] has been in development for a few months now. It is now time for the roll-out of the first part of it on your Wikipedia. Phase 1 is the support for the management of language links. It is already being used on the Hungarian, Hebrew, Italian and English Wikipedias. The next step is to enable the extension on all other Wikipedias. We have currently planned this for March 6.

=== What is Wikidata? ===
Wikidata is a central place to store data that you can usually find in infoboxes. Think of it as something like Wikimedia Commons but for data (like the number of inhabitants of a country or the length of a river) instead of multimedia. The first part of this project (centralizing language links) is being rolled out now. The more fancy things will follow later.

=== What is going to happen? ===
Language links in the sidebar are going to come from Wikidata in addition to the ones in the wiki text. To edit them, scroll to the bottom of the language links, and click edit. You no longer need to maintain these links by hand in the wiki text of the article.

=== Where can I find more information and ask questions? ===
Editors on en:wp have created a [[:en:Wikipedia:Wikidata|great page with all the necessary information for editors]] and there is also an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

=== I want to be kept up to date about Wikidata ===
To stay up-to-date on everything happening around Wikidata please [[meta:Global message delivery/Targets/Wikidata|subscribe]] to the newsletter that is delivered weekly to subscribed user’s talk pages. You can see previous editions [[meta:Wikidata/Newsletter/Archive|here]].

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this locally. If you understand German better than English you can have a look at the announcement on [[:de:Wikipedia:Kurier]].

As I annonced 2 weeks ago, [[d:|Wikidata]] phase 1 (language links) has been deployed here today. Language links in the sidebar are coming from Wikidata in addition to the ones in the wiki text. To edit them, scroll to the bottom of the language links, and click edit. You no longer need to maintain these links by hand in the wiki text of the article.

== Convert complex templates to Lua to make them faster and more powerful ==

<small>(Please consider translating this message for the benefit of your fellow Wikimedians)</small>

Greetings. As you might have seen on the [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/11/lua-templates-faster-more-flexible-pages/ Wikimedia tech blog] or the [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-ambassadors/2013-March/000171.html tech ambassadors list], a new functionality called "Lua" is being enabled on all Wikimedia sites today. [[mw:Lua|Lua]] is a scripting language that enables you to write faster and more powerful MediaWiki templates.

If you have questions about how to convert existing templates to Lua (or how to create new ones), we'll be holding two support sessions on IRC next week: [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=02&min=00&sec=0&day=20&month=03&year=2013 one on Wednesday] (for Oceania, Asia & America) and [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=18&min=00&sec=0&day=22&month=03&year=2013 one on Friday] (for Europe, Africa & America); see [[m:IRC office hours]] for the details. If you can't make it, you can also get help at [[mw:Talk:Lua scripting]].

If you'd like to learn about this kind of events earlier in advance, consider becoming a [[m:Tech/Ambassadors|Tech ambassador]] by subscribing to the [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-ambassadors mailing list]. You will also be able to help your fellow Wikimedians have a voice in technical discussions and be notified of important decisions.

== Wikidata phase 2 (infoboxes) coming to this Wikipedia ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this. If you understand German better than English you can have a look at the announcement on [[:de:Wikipedia:Kurier]].

A while ago the first phase of [[d:|Wikidata]] was enabled on this Wikipedia. This means you are getting the language links in each article from Wikidata. It is soon time to enable the second phase of Wikidata (infoboxes) here. We have already done this on the [[http://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/03/27/you-can-have-all-the-data/ first 11 Wikipedias]] (it, he, hu, ru, tr, uk, uz, hr, bs, sr, sh) and things are looking good. The next step is English Wikipedia. This is planned for April 8. '''If everything works out fine we will deploy on all remaining Wikipedias on April 10.''' I will update [[m:Wikidata/Deployment Questions#When_will_this_be_deployed_on_my_Wikipedia.3F|this part of the FAQ]] if there are any issues forcing us to change this date. I will also sent another note to this village pump once the deployment is finished.

'''What will happen once we have phase 2 enabled here?'''
Once it is enabled in a few days you will be able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!)

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Yahoo!. This will return “[[d:Q14086|Marissa Mayer]]” as she is the [[d:Property:P169|chief executive officer]] of the [[d:Q37093|company]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use <nowiki>{{#property:chief executive officer}}</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki>. The complete plan for this is [[meta:Wikidata/Notes/Inclusion syntax|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can already test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2].

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
We have collected the main questions in an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

Hello!

There is [[m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|a new request for comment]] on Meta-Wiki concerning the removal of administrative rights from long-term inactive Wikimedians. Generally, this proposal from stewards would apply to wikis without an administrators' review process.

We are also compiling a [[m:Talk:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|list of projects]] with procedures for removing inactive administrators on the talk page of the request for comment. Feel free to add your project(s) to the list if you have a policy on administrator inactivity.

All input is appreciated. The discussion may close as soon as 21 May 2013 (2013-05-21), but this will be extended if needed.

Today all the remaining Wikipedias followed.

'''What does having phase 2 enabled here mean?'''
You are now able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!) The current state is just the beginning though. It will be extended based on feedback we get from you now.

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p159}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Wikimedia Foundation. This will return “[[d:Q62|San Francisco]]” as that is the [[d:Property:P159|headquarter location]] of the [[d:180|non-profit]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2] if you don't want to do it in an article here.

== [en] Change to section edit links ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr">
The default position of the "edit" link in page section headers is going to change soon. The "edit" link will be positioned adjacent to the page header text rather than floating opposite it.

Section edit links will be to the immediate right of section titles, instead of on the far right. If you're an editor of one of the wikis which already implemented this change, nothing will substantially change for you; however, scripts and gadgets depending on the previous implementation of section edit links will have to be adjusted to continue working; however, nothing else should break even if they are not updated in time.

[[m:Change to section edit links|Detailed information and a timeline]] is available on meta.

Ideas to do this all the way to 2009 at least. It is often difficult to track which of several potential section edit links on the far right is associated with the correct section, and many readers and anonymous or new editors may even be failing to notice section edit links at all, since they read section titles, which are far away from the links.

== Pywikipedia is migrating to git ==

Hello, Sorry for English but It's very important for bot operators so I hope someone translates this.
[[mw:PWB|Pywikipedia]] is migrating to Git so after July 26, SVN checkouts won't be updated If you're using Pywikipedia you have to switch to git, otherwise you will use out-dated framework and your bot might not work properly. There is a [[mw:Manual:Pywikipediabot/Gerrit|manual]] for doing that and a [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/07/23/pywikipediabot-moving-to-git-on-july-26/ blog post] explaining about this change in non-technical language.

== VisualEditor and your Wikipedia ==

''(Please translate this message)''

Greetings,

The Wikimedia Foundation will soon turn on [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] for all users, all the time on your Wikipedia. Right now your Wikipedia does not have any local documents on VisualEditor, and we hope that your community can change that. To find out about how you can help with translations visit the [[mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|TranslationCentral for VisualEditor]] and read the easy instructions on [[mw:VisualEditor/Portal/Localization|bringing information to your Wikipedia]]. The [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|User Guide]] and the [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/FAQ|FAQ]] are very important to have in your language.
 
We want to find out as much as we can from you about VisualEditor and how it helps your Wikipedia, and having local pages is a great way to start. We also encourage you to [[mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|leave feedback on Mediawiki]] where the community can offer ideas, opinions, and point out bugs that may still exist in the software that need to be reported to [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=VisualEditor Bugzilla]. 
If you are able to speak for the concerns of others in English on MediaWiki or locally I encourage you to help your community to be represented in this process.

If you can help translate the user interface for VisualEditor to your language, you can help with that as well. [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc Translatewiki] has open tasks for translating VisualEditor. A direct link to translate the user interface is [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Special:Translate?filter=!translated&action=translate&group=ext-visualeditor here].  You can see how we are doing with those translations [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc here]. You need an account on Translatewiki to translate.  This account is free and easy to create.

If we can help your community in any way with this process, please let me know and I will do my best to assist your Wikipedia with this |exciting development. You can contact me on my [[m:User_talk:Keegan (WMF)|meta talk page]] or by [[Special:EmailUser/Keegan (WMF)|email]].  You can also contact [[mw:User_talk:PEarley_(WMF)|Patrick Earley]] for help with translations and documents on Mediawiki.  We look forward to working with you to bring the VisualEditor experience to your Wikipedia! [[:m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[:m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 19:02, 30 七月 2013 (UTC)

''(This message is in English, please translate as needed)''

Greetings!  

[[mw:Echo|Notifications]] will inform users about new activity that affects them on this wiki in a unified way: for example, this new tool will let you know when you have new talk page messages, edit reverts, mentions or links -- and is designed to augment (rather than replace) the watchlist. The Wikimedia Foundation's editor engagement team developed this tool (code-named 'Echo') earlier this year, to help users contribute more productively to MediaWiki projects. 

We're now getting ready to bring Notifications to almost all other Wikimedia sites, and are aiming for a 22 October deployment, as outlined in [[mw:Echo/Release_Plan_2013|this release plan]]. It is important that notifications is translated for all of the languages we serve.  

There are three major points of translation needed to be either done or checked:
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-echo#sortable:3=desc Echo on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-thanks#sortable:3=desc Thanks on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[[mw:Help:Notifications|Notifications help on mediawiki.org]].  This page can be hosted after translation on mediawiki.org or we can localize it to this Wikipedia.  You do not have to have an account to translate on mediawiki, but single-user login will create it for you there if you follow the link.
:*[[mw:Echo/Release Plan 2013#Checklist|Checklist]]

Please let us know if you have any questions, suggestions or comments about this new tool.

== Speak up about the trademark registration of the Community logo. ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hi all, 

Please join the consultation about the Community logo that represents Meta-Wiki: [[:m:Community Logo/Request for consultation]].

This community consultation was commenced on September 24. The following day, two individuals filed a legal opposition against the registration of the Community logo.

The question is whether the Wikimedia Foundation should seek a collective membership mark with respect to this logo or abandon its registration and protection of the trademark. 

We want to make sure that everyone get a chance to speak up so that we can get clear direction from the community.  We would therefore really appreciate the community's help in translating this announcement from English so that everyone is able to understand it.

== Introducting Beta Features ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''(Apologies for writing in English. Please translate if necessary)''

We would like to let you know about [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features]], a new program from the Wikimedia Foundation that lets you try out new features before they are released for everyone.

Think of it as a digital laboratory where community members can preview upcoming software and give feedback to help improve them. This special preference page lets designers and engineers experiment with new features on a broad scale, but in a way that's not disruptive.

Beta Features is now ready for testing on [[mw:Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|MediaWiki.org]]. It will also be released on Wikimedia Commons and MetaWiki this Thursday, 7 November. Based on test results, the plan is to release it on all wikis worldwide on 21 November, 2013.

Here are the first features you can test this week:
* [[mw:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|Media Viewer]] — view images in large size or full screen
* [[mw:VisualEditor/Beta_Features/Formulae|VisualEditor Formulæ]] (for wikis with [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]) — edit algebra or equations on your pages
* [[mw:Typography_Update|Typography Refresh]] —  make text more readable (coming Thursday)

Would you like to try out Beta Features now? After you log in on MediaWiki.org, a small 'Beta' link will appear next to your 'Preferences'. Click on it to see features you can test, check the ones you want, then click 'Save'. Learn more on the [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features page]].

After you've tested Beta Features, please let the developers know what you think on [[mw:Talk:About_Beta_Features|this discussion page]] -- or report any bugs [http://wmbug.com/new?product=MediaWiki%20extensions&component=BetaFeatures here on Bugzilla]. You're also welcome to join [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|this IRC office hours chat]] on Friday, 8 November at 18:30 UTC. 

Beta Features was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation's Design, Multimedia and VisualEditor teams. Along with other developers, they will be adding new features to this experimental program every few weeks. They are very grateful to all the community members who helped create this project — and look forward to many more productive collaborations in the future.

Enjoy, and don't forget to let developers know what you think!  [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 19:59, 5 十一月 2013 (UTC)

== Call for comments on draft trademark policy ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hi all, 

The Wikimedia legal team invites you to participate in the development of the new Wikimedia trademark policy.

The [[:wmf:Trademark policy|current trademark policy]] was introduced in 2009 to protect the [[:wmf:Wikimedia trademarks|Wikimedia marks]]. We are now updating this policy to better balance permissive use of the marks with the legal requirements for preserving them for the community. The new draft trademark policy is ready for your review [[:m:Trademark policy|here]], and we encourage you to discuss it [[:m:Talk:Trademark policy|here]].

== Request for comment on Commons: Should Wikimedia support MP4 video? ==

''I apologize for this message being only in English. Please translate it if needed to help your community.''

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|multimedia team]] seeks community guidance on a proposal to support the [[w:MP4|MP4 video format]]. This digital video standard is used widely around the world to record, edit and watch videos on mobile phones, desktop computers and home video devices. It is also known as [[w:MP4|H.264/MPEG-4 or AVC]].

Supporting the MP4 format would make it much easier for our users to view and contribute video on Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects -- and video files could be offered in dual formats on our sites, so we could continue to support current open formats (WebM and Ogg Theora). 

However, MP4 is a patent-encumbered format, and using a proprietary format would be a departure from our current practice of only supporting open formats on our sites -- even though the licenses appear to have acceptable legal terms, with only a small fee required. 

We would appreciate your guidance on whether or not to support MP4. Our Request for Comments presents views both in favor and against MP4 support, based on opinions we’ve heard in our discussions with community and team members. 

[[commons:Commons:Requests for comment/MP4 Video|Please join this RfC -- and share your advice]].

All users are welcome to participate, whether you are active on Commons, Wikipedia, other Wikimedia project -- or any site that uses content from our free media repository.

You are also welcome to join tomorrow's [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|Office hours chat on IRC]],  this Thursday, January 16, at 19:00 UTC, if you would like to discuss this project with our team and other community members.

We look forward to a constructive discussion with you, so we can make a more informed decision together on this important topic. [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 06:47, 16 一月 2014 (UTC)

== Universal Language Selector will be enabled by default again on this wiki by 21 February 2014 ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
On January 21 2014 the MediaWiki extension [[mw:Universal Language Selector|Universal Language Selector]] (ULS) was [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Jan2014|disabled]] on this wiki. A new preference was added for logged-in users to turn on ULS. This was done to prevent slow loading of pages due to ULS webfonts, a behaviour that had been observed by the Wikimedia Technical Operations team on some wikis. 

We are now ready to enable ULS again. The temporary preference to enable ULS will be removed. A [[commons:File:ULS-font-checkbox.png|new checkbox]] has been added to the Language Panel to enable/disable font delivery. This will be unchecked by default for this wiki, but can be selected at any time by the users to enable webfonts. This is an interim solution while we improve the feature of webfonts delivery.

You can read the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Feb2014|announcement]] and the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Upcoming Development Plan|development plan]] for more information. Apologies for writing this message only in English. Thank you. [[m:User_talk:Runab WMF|Runa]]

== Changes to the default site typography coming soon ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 
This week, the typography on Wikimedia sites will be updated for all readers and editors who use the default "Vector" skin. This change will involve new serif fonts for some headings, small tweaks to body content fonts, text size, text color, and spacing between elements. The schedule is: 

* '''April 1st''': non-Wikipedia projects will see this change live
* '''April 3rd''': Wikipedias will see this change live

This change is very similar to the "Typography Update" Beta Feature that has been available on Wikimedia projects since November 2013. After several rounds of testing and with feedback from the community, this Beta Feature will be disabled and successful aspects enabled in the default site appearance. Users who are logged in may still choose to use another skin, or alter their [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|personal CSS]], if they prefer a different appearance. Local [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common CSS]] styles will also apply as normal, for issues with local styles and scripts that impact all users.

[[Image:Commons-logo.svg|right|220px|alt=Wikimedia Commons logo]]
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hello! Sorry for writing in English. It was noted that on this wiki upload is not fully functional for users, who will experience a very difficult and/or [[wmf:Resolution:Licensing policy|illegal]] uploading. In fact, the [[MediaWiki:Licenses|licenses/copyright tags dropdown]] is empty, making it hard or impossible to comply with copyright requirements during upload itself.

Presumably, you don't have interest nor energies to have [[commons:Category:Licensing templates|hundreds templates]] with the [[mw:Multimedia/Media Viewer/Template compatibility|now required HTML]], even less a local [[m:EDP|EDP]].
I propose to have
* '''[[Special:Upload|local "{{int:upload}}"]] [[commons:Commons:Turning off local uploads|restricted]]''' to the "{{int:group-sysop}}" group (for emergency uploads) and
* the '''sidebar point to [[commons:Special:UploadWizard]]''',
so that you can avoid local maintenance and all users can have a functioning, easy upload interface [[translatewiki:Special:Translate/ext-uploadwizard|in their own language]]. All registered users can upload on Commons and [[Special:ListFiles|existing files]] will not be affected.

All this will get done around 2014-07-03.
# If you disagree with the proposal, just [[m:User:Nemo bis/Unused local uploads|remove your wiki from the list]]. Remember also to create [[MediaWiki:Licenses]] locally with any content (see a [[s:fr:MediaWiki:Licenses|simple example]]), or uploads will be soon disabled anyway by MediaWiki itself (starting in [[mw:MediaWiki_1.24/Roadmap|version 1.24wmf11]]).
# To make the UploadWizard even better, please tell your experience and ideas on [[commons:Commons:Upload Wizard feedback]].

== Media Viewer is now live on this wiki ==

<br>
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[File:Media_Viewer_Desktop_-_Large_Image_Opaque_Info.png|thumb|Media Viewer lets you see images in larger size]]

Greetings— and sorry for writing in English, please translate if it will help your community,

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|Multimedia team]] is happy to announce that [[mw:Multimedia/About Media Viewer|Media Viewer]] was just released on this site today. 

Media Viewer displays images in larger size when you click on their thumbnails, to provide a better viewing experience. Users can now view images faster and more clearly, without having to jump to separate pages — and its user interface is more intuitive, offering easy access to full-resolution images and information, with links to the file repository for editing. The tool has been tested extensively across all Wikimedia wikis over the past six months as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|Beta Feature]] and has been [[mw:Multimedia/Media_Viewer/Release_Plan#Timeline|released]] to the largest Wikipedias, all language Wikisources, and the English Wikivoyage already.

If you do not like this feature, you can easily turn it off by clicking on "Disable Media Viewer" at the bottom of the screen, pulling up the information panel (or in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering|your preferences]]) whether you have an account or not. Learn more [[mw:Help:Multimedia/Media_Viewer#How_can_I_turn_off_this_feature.3F|in this Media Viewer Help page]].

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments about Media Viewer. You are invited to [[mw:Talk:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|share your feedback in this discussion on MediaWiki.org]] in any language, to help improve this feature. You are also welcome to [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-all?c=announce-all take this quick survey in English], [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-fr en français], [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-es o español].

We hope you enjoy Media Viewer. Many thanks to all the community members who helped make it possible. - [[mw:User:Fabrice Florin (WMF)|Fabrice Florin (WMF)]]  ([[m:User talk:Fabrice Florin (WMF)|talk]]) 21:54, 19 六月 2014 (UTC)

Hello and sorry for writing in English. Can anyone help me translate a small article (2 paragraphs) from English to your language and create the article in your wiki?

== Letter petitioning WMF to reverse recent decisions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation recently created a new feature, "superprotect" status. The purpose is to prevent pages from being edited by elected administrators -- but permitting WMF staff to edit them. It has been put to use in only one case: to protect the deployment of the Media Viewer software on German Wikipedia, in defiance of a clear decision of that community to disable the feature by default, unless users decide to enable it.

If you oppose these actions, please add your name to this letter. If you know non-Wikimedians who support our vision for the free sharing of knowledge, and would like to add their names to the list, please ask them to sign an identical version of the letter on change.org.

== Process ideas for software development ==

<div class=”mw-content-ltr”>
’’My apologies for writing in English.’’

Hello,

I am notifying you that a brainstorming session has been [[:m:Community Engagement (Product)/Process ideas|started on Meta]] to help the Wikimedia Foundation increase and better affect community participation in software development across all wiki projects. Basically, how can you be more involved in helping to create features on Wikimedia projects?  We are inviting all interested users to voice their ideas on how communities can be more involved and informed in the product development process at the Wikimedia Foundation. It would be very appreciated if you could translate this message to help inform your local communities as well.

I and the rest of [[:m:Community Engagement (Product)|my team]] welcome you to participate. We hope to see you on Meta.

Kind regards,
-- [[m:User:Rdicerb (WMF)|Rdicerb (WMF)]] [[m:User talk:Rdicerb (WMF)|talk]] 22:15, 21 八月 2014 (UTC)

== Meta RfCs on two new global groups ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello all, 

There are currently requests for comment open on meta to create two new global groups. The first is a group for members of the OTRS permissions queue, which would grant them autopatrolled rights on all wikis except those who opt-out. That proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Creation of a global OTRS-permissions user group]]. The second is a group for Wikimedia Commons admins and OTRS agents to view deleted file pages through the 'viewdeletedfile' right on all wikis except those who opt-out. The second proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Global file deletion review]].

We would like to hear what you think on both proposals. Both are in English; if you wanted to translate them into your native language that would also be appreciated.

It is possible for individual projects to opt-out, so that users in those groups do not have any additional rights on those projects. To do this please start a local discussion, and if there is consensus you can request to opt-out of either or both at [[m:Stewards' noticeboard]].

Thanks and regards, [[m:User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]] ([[m:User talk:Ajraddatz|talk]]) 18:04, 26 十月 2014 (UTC)</div>

== Global AbuseFilter ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello,

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:AbuseFilter|AbuseFilter]] is a MediaWiki extension used to detect likely abusive behavior patterns, like pattern vandalism and spam. In 2013, [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter|Global AbuseFilters]] were enabled on a limited set of wikis including Meta-Wiki, MediaWiki.org, Wikispecies and (in early 2014) all the "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=small.dblist small wikis]". Recently, global abuse filters were enabled on "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=medium.dblist medium sized wikis]" as well. These filters are currently managed by stewards on Meta-Wiki and have shown to be very effective in preventing mass spam attacks across Wikimedia projects. However, there is currently no policy on how the global AbuseFilters will be managed although there are proposals. There is an ongoing [[m:Requests for comment/Global AbuseFilter|request for comment]] on policy governing the use of the global AbuseFilters. In the meantime, specific wikis can opt out of using the global AbuseFilter. These wikis can simply add a request to [[m:Global AbuseFilter/Opt-out wikis|this list]] on Meta-Wiki. More details can be found on [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter/2014 announcement|this page]] at Meta-Wiki. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on [[m:Talk:Global AbuseFilter|m:Talk:Global AbuseFilter]].
