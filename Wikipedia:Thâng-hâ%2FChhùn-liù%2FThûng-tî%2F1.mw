==Betawiki: better support for your language in MediaWiki ==
Dear community. I am writing to you to promote a special wiki called [http://nike.users.idler.fi/betawiki Betawiki]. This wiki facilitates the localisation (l10n) of the MediaWiki interface. You may have changed many messages here to use your language in the interface, but if you would log in to for example the English language Wiktionary, you would not be able to use the interface as well translated as here. Infact, of the 1798 messages in the core of MediaWiki, 1360 messages have been translated. Betawiki also supports the translation of messages of about 80 extensions, with almost 1000 messages.

If you wish to contribute to better support of your language in MediaWiki, as well as for many MediaWiki extensions, please visit [http://nike.users.idler.fi/betawiki/Translating:Intro Betawiki], [http://nike.users.idler.fi/dev/?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup&uselang=en create an account] and [http://nike.users.idler.fi/betawiki/Betawiki:Rights request translator priviledges]. You can see the current status of localisation of your language on [[meta:Localization_statistics|meta]] and do not forget to get in touch with others that may already be [http://nike.users.idler.fi/betawiki/Translating:Languages working on your language on Betawiki].

If you have any further questions, [http://nike.users.idler.fi/betawiki/User_talk:Siebrand please let me know on my talk page on Betawiki]. We will try and assist you as much as possible, for example by importing all messages from a local wiki for you to start with, if you so desire.

You can also find us on the Freenode [[w:en:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network in the channel #mediawiki-i18n where we would be happy to help you get started.

Thank you very much for your attention and I do hope to see some of you on [http://nike.users.idler.fi/betawiki/Etusivu Betawiki] soon! Cheers! [http://nike.users.idler.fi/betawiki/User:Siebrand Siebrand@Betawiki] 09:36, 28 Kiú-ngie̍t 2007 (UTC)
